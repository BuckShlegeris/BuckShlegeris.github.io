title: "App Academy questions"

These are my answers to some great, in depth questions which someone asked me.

> 1) Does App Academy have a mission/mission statement? <br/>
>   a. I read that the founders wanted to provide a cost effective credible training. But, besides this vision of accessibility, does the school hope its students will go on to use their skills in any particular way? <br/>
>   b.  Doing a little research, I found your 80,000 Hours interview, and saw that you had an interest in effective altruism. Is this part of the App Academy ethos as well? <br/>
>   c. Finally, if it is helpful, maybe you can share with me why you chose to stay on at App Academy, when presumably you could have been employed at a host of other jobs.

App Academy wasn't started with any particular altruistic mindset, and doesn't have a particularly EA ethos.

I took the App Academy job for a few reasons:

- The job started immediately after my App Academy cohort ended. So I could start work immediately. That was directly lucrative.
- I thought that after I'd been at App Academy for six months, I'd have learned a lot, so it would be much easier to find better jobs.
- Job searching right out of App Academy with nothing else to do is super unpleasant. I suspected that TAing would be more fun than aimlessly job searching.
- I liked the fact that I'd have the flexibility to leave after six months and go back to university if I wanted to.

I think all that reasoning looks pretty sensible in hindsight.

> 2) Why should one do App Academy? <br/>
>    a. And, who is it wrong for? Or more broadly, why shouldn’t one do App Academy? <br/>
>    b.    Are there other equivalent options?

App Academy is great at teaching you a reasonable amount about programming and web development.

It is somewhat expensive. If you can get a job without doing it, you should probably do so. But it's quite hard to learn everything you need on your own. I'm happy to talk about what kind of things I'd recommend doing if you wanted to learn on your own.

If you have little aptitude for programming, you probably shouldn't do App Academy. Hopefully they'll screen you out if you have little aptitude for it, though.

Other equivalent options: Hack Reactor is probably about as good as a/A, but it doesn't have the same payment model. I think most other bootcamps are worse.

> 3) What makes a strong App Academy applicant? What is App Academy looking for? <br/>
a. My impression is that there is a 3% acceptance rate, what sets accepted students apart from the other 97%. <br/>
b.    Or maybe more importantly, among the top 10% of applicants, what distinguishes the top 3%.

Back in my day, we just wanted to see that you were able to solve a reasonably simple coding problem that we gave you over the phone. I think they also care a little about credentials which are hard to shift. Eg they'd rather accept someone who has a physics degree from Stanford than someone who doesn't, because the former credential will help out the job search.

I'm not sure if that's still true. I'll ask an App Academy TA I know.

> 4) In slightly different terms, what can I do to make myself as competitive as possible? <br/>
a. I’m in my final semester of my liberal arts humanities major, and don’t have a coding background. <br/>
b.    I saw your Quora advice to do Code Academy Ruby course, and I did complete that. (although not Ruby on Rails). <br/>
c. Are there any other ways for me to raise my chances?

I'm pretty sure the best thing to do is just to get as good at programming as possible. I recommend doing exercises from Exercism.io or Leetcode, starting from the easy exercises.

Your background seems like not particularly a weakness or a strength.
