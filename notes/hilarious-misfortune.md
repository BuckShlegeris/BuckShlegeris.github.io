title: "My policy on hilarious misfortune"
---

If I ever die or get horribly harmed by some incident which is sad but also hilarious or ironic in some way, I encourage everyone to not feel bad about making jokes about it. I promise I won't mind.

I don't particularly expect ironic misfortunie to happen, I just don't want anyone to act overly serious if it does.
