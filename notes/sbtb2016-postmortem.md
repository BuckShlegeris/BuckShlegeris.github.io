I am somewhat happy with [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey5fOCcWpM8) but it could have been better.

I probably spent too much time motivating the problem, and too little time walking through my solution. I only actually start describing my algorithms at 11 minutes in, and then I was rushed as I discussed them. I should have cut out everything from about 5m to 11m, and then spent that additional six minutes explaining my solution more slowly and more completely.
