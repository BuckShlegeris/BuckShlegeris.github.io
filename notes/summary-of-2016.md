## Initial overview

### What went well?

I am very happy with my relationship with Claire.

I presented at Scala By The Bay, which took a lot of my effort and was pretty fun.

Work went alright? I don't know how I feel about this. To some extent I did well--I got a raise--and I was generally useful. I've been feeling worse at my job for the last month or so, and I don't know how much that is my fault.

I learned a bunch of economics, and proved an interesting (to me at least) theorem.

I started writing more.

I talked at EA Global and got a few extra people to like me.

### What went badly?

I didn't exercise as much as I'd want to. I did a reasonable amount with Aubrey, I guess, but slightly less than once a week on average total I think.

I got drunk and behaved inappropiately at an Asgard party.

I got frustrated and angry with my colleagues much more than was reasonable.

I think I behaved foolishly about rationalism. I should sort out what I want my relationship to rationalism to be.

### Where did I try hard?

SBTB. Claire, probably.

### Where did I not try hard enough?

Being nice to rationalists.

## Status report

### Values and purpose

I am actually pretty confident about this stuff
