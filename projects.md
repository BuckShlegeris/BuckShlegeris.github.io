Here are some projects which I want to work on myself, or which I think would be fun for someone else to work on.

## Choosing fast data structures and algorithms based on usage

Read the description on [my github repo](https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview).

### Subprojects

There are several different ways you can approach this problem.

- **Composing data structures**. This is the approach I looked at in my Scala By The Bay talk. You take a list of descriptions of data structures, and come up with a way of automatically choosing which you should compose. There is some existing research on this; I want to make my solution be easier to use.
- **Automatically generating dynamic programming solutions on arrays**

## Data structure implementation

I would love to see a clearly documented implementation of the following data structures:

- k-d tree with self-balancing insert. This should be possible but I haven't seen it.

## Markdown editor

I want a nice Markdown editor which displays my formatting as I write it.
