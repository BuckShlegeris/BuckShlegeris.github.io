Here is an incomplete list of mistakes I've made:

- I [thought I had found a proof](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208985027237631&set=a.1254922647920.38754.1075180788&type=3) related to bundling, but I was wrong. I posted the proof to Facebook very late at night.
  - Process which would have prevented this mistake:
    - I should have checked my conjecture against the toy simulation of the problem which I'd already built
    - I could have written a program to randomly test the conjecture.
      - TODO: I should use Quickcheck to demonstrate the falsehood of my claim, so that I'm more practiced at Quickcheck.
    - I could have sent the post to one person instead of many
    - I could have slept on it
