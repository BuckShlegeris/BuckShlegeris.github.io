ECONOMY: free small business to create jobs, reduce state debt</a>

        <p>Queensland's debt is over $16,000 per person, the highest of all states.
This is after many years of booming mining activity.  The state with the
second-highest debt per capita is Western Australia.</p>
<p>But wait a minute--Queensland and WA enjoyed a huge surge in mining activity
over the past decade, right?  Why do these two states have nothing to show
for all of that activity except for a giant debt burden?</p>
<p>Here's the answer:  the mining companies take almost all of the profit
offshore while leaving the infrastructure costs, the environmental
destruction, and the clean-up costs to the government.</p>
<p>Both of the old-fashioned parties are stuck in the past, imagining that big
business and big projects will somehow come to the rescue.  Apart from
consultancies and directorships for retired politicians, the mega-projects
have nothing to offer to Queensland.</p>
<p>All of the new jobs in Queensland and especially in the seat of Noosa will
come from small business.</p>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>Small businesses create virtually all of the new jobs in Queensland.</p>
<p>I have owned and operated businesses in Queensland and I have served as a
director and advisor to many more.  Here in Noosa I serve as a volunteer
mentor with the Business Mentors Noosa and work with the proprietors of
several small businesses.</p>
<p>I understand the issues faced by small business.  Two of the biggest are
payroll tax and stamp duty, both of which actively destroy jobs.  Neither
Labor nor the LNP can address these issues because they’re both beholden to
big business.  Big business extracts other concessions from government to
offset the inconvenience of stamp duty and payroll tax.  Small business
deserves real support.</p>

        <p>The best economic policies are perfectly compatible with the best
environmental policies.</p>
<p>Queensland’s solar energy resource is gigantic.  Look beyond the
mismanagement of the present electricity system and you can see a time in
which electricity is abundant, clean, and cheap.  Households and businesses
can already save a bundle by generating their own electricity.  This
on-site generation will increase dramatically once the state gets out of
the way.</p>
<p>Queensland could choose to be a major producer of aluminium or magnesium,
for example, using abundant and cheap solar electricity.  Such materials
are themselves important for energy-saving advances in transport and other
industries.  Queensland can choose to start this virtuous, job-creating
cycle.  The first step is to vote Green.</p>

    <div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">
       <p>We must eliminate Queensland’s giant new tax on electricity users.</p>
<p>Queensland’s electricity system has entered its death spiral.  As prices
rise faster and faster, people find ways to use less.  This means the price
has to rise even faster to keep the electricity generators from going
broke.</p>
<p>The current government’s desperate ploy to delay the inevitable is to
increase every household’s fixed charge.  That’s the fee you pay just for
being connected, rather than for the electricity you use.  This tax/fee has
increased by $227 for every single connection in just the past two years.
This is a great big new tax on every Queenslander which has no purpose
other than papering over the mismanagement of the electricity system by
successive governments on both sides.</p>
<p>Queensland’s existing grid could have great value, delivering low-cost,
clean energy from a vast and competitive array of private suppliers.  This
need not cost the state anything, as the private sector is busting to
install large-scale solar and wind capacity.  The state just needs to get
out of the way.</p>

shut our most important public health facility.  A vote for the Greens
