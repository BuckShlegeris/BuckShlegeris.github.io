## What bootcamp should I go to?

In SF, App Academy and Hack Reactor have the best graduates. This is probably partially selection effect and partially teaching quality. (It's also partially an effect where having good students means you can teach faster, which increases teaching quality.) Go to one of those.

## What App Academy prep should I do?

After applying, they send you preparation materials. I think that doing those is probably a good start, and probably sufficient.

After doing the prep materials, you could study more. (Studying more is a good use of time anyway, because the more knowledgeable you are at the start of the course, the more employable youâ€™ll be after it.)
