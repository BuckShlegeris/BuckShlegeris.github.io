> What bootcamp should I go to?

In SF, App Academy and Hack Reactor have the best graduates. This is probably partially selection effect and partially teaching quality. (It's also partially an effect where having good students means you can teach faster, which increases teaching quality.) Go to one of those.

> What App Academy prep should I do?

After applying, they send you preparation materials. I think that doing those is probably a good start, and probably sufficient.

After doing the prep materials, you could study more. (Studying more is a good use of time anyway, because the more knowledgeable you are at the start of the course, the more employable youâ€™ll be after it.)

> Do you know how unfavourably/favourably they look on previous formal study?  I have the option to do some university subjects in the current semester on algorithms and data structures, or alternatively, to do some self learning and wondering whether having done university study would be a disadvantage.

University study is probably a minor advantage. You should do whichever of those is more effective at teaching you algorithms, rather than optimizing for looking good. University study is definitely not a disadvantage.

> Do you know if the answer to the "Any programming experience?" question matters much?

They probably somewhat prefer you to have more programming experience.
