## On The Ethology Of Pain, Its Experience And Expression


The question whether animals experience pain has found different answers. The question cannot be answered in as far as it deals with the aspect of subjective experience; this is inaccessible to empirical investigation, for fundamental reasons. Host scientists, however, will accept a 'postulate of homology': because sensory and neural processes and structures are organised in essentially similar ways, at least in mammals, they feel bound to assume that these animals know experiences that are homologous to ours. also with respect to the sensation of pain (20). A more modest approach is to investigate the behavioural responses to damaging influences.


In this contribution I shall view the phenomenon of pain, its behavioural manifestations and their adaptive significance from an ethological perspective. It is remarkable that pain has attracted only little attention in the ethological literature (13). In the quest for principles of behavioural organization and of the adaptive significance of behaviour in all its diversity, attention has not been drawn towards 'disrupted systems' , i. e. animals injured or ill. In learning psychology the phenomenon has commanded much more attention. This is not astonishing since research concerning the conditioning of behaviour has typically used two categories of reinforcers, rewards and punishments. The latter mostly took the form of pain stimuli, namely electric shocks, administered in rather artificial experimental situations. Because of this a notion about the nature and functional significance of pain has become established, which is rather one-sided and narrow.


### The role of pain as a cause of fear


Pain has always been regarded as a mechanism that warns when there is (the danger of) injury. and that releases behaviour averting the danger and preventing further damage by withdrawal and/or defense (5). The generation of fear (readiness to flee) of things or circumstances that were associated with the infliction of damage has also been regarded as an important function. Pain then figures as the unconditional stimulus in a Pavlovian conditioning scheme. This has led to the idea that fear in the conditioned response to pain. Pain causes fear and this motivates behaviour directed at the avoidance of danger (18).

In this conception of pain and its relation to fear the diversity of stimuli which in nature generate and reinforce fear has gone lost from sight. Ethologists in particular have realized that there is a variety of flight releasing stimuli which do not derive their effectiveness from an association with pain (21). Fear of predators, for instance, cannot primarily be based on pain conditioning, because the first confrontation with the supposed unconditional stimulus is often the last (3). Other mechanisms, for instance instigation by social example, must be postulated.

### Two kinds of pain

Experiments with electric shock have one more limitation: they do not lead to injury. We know, however, that man experiences two kinds of pain. First, there is an immediate, sharp and well localizable pain, the 'acute' or 'primary' pain, which triggers fast withdrawal reflexes. These reflexes remain after the brain connections have been severed. So, even though we may be aware of this pain, the reactions are not dependent on such awareness. This implies that the existence of such reflexes in animals does not necessarily imply that they sense pain. Later there is a less localized, slow growing and long lasting dull pain, the 'chronic' or 'secondary' pain (5). There are detailed ideas about the physiological mechanisms concerned. Well known is the "gate theory" of Melzack & Wall (15), which postulates a peripheral mechanism by which the primary pain process temporarily inhibits the transmission of secondary pain signals to central neural stations. In addition there are central mechanisms of inhibition, and of late we know that endorphins play a role in these.

All this raises questions about the functional relations between these phenomena. Recently Bolles & Fanselow (4) have brought the different data within one explanatory frame-work, their so-called "perceptive-defensive-recuperative" (PDR) model of pain, in which they distinguish three phases of reaction to injury. In the perceptive phase pain stimuli alert the animal to the source of pain, and the animal may learn about its characteristics. These stimuli also immediately trigger reactions meant to escape from and avert the danger: the defensive phase. Essential in the PDR model is the recuperative phase; now the injury really starts to hurt and this resets motivational priorities; the pain now motivates behaviour conducive to recovery and the healing of the injury: withdrawal to a secluded and safe spot, licking of the wounds and refraining from other activities, 5.5. a loss of appetite and a decreased motivation to feed.

The traditional notion is that pain strengthens the fear of the dangerous situation and that fearfulness is thus connected with pain. The PDR conception, on the other hand, regards pain as a motivational antagonist not only of fear, but also of aggression and other motivations. In the defensive phase, when the organism has to deal with the situation he is involved in, including the inherent danger, the pain hardly hurts him, if he senses it at all. The pain is inhibited and endorphins may play a role in this. Only after "the heat of the fight", after things have been settled, the pain swells and now, in turn, inhibits all other motivations conflicting with the organism's urge to 'withdraw in suffering'. A depressed and apathetic attitude and a lack of interest in all but the pain itself and the circumstances associated with it, is characteristic for the human chronic pain patient (16, 19). Similar behaviour occurs during illness; then it is a response to the sensations of nausea and sickness, rather than of pain. This apathetic behaviour undoubtedly is a biologically adaptive response, which like depressions in other circumstances (e.g. when an organism repeatedly experiences negative effects of its actions) need not be meaningless and pathological; on the contrary: a curbing of motivations can enable the organism to sit and wait for times in which action and initiative may prove fruitful again (25). Similarly, pain-induced depression is to be regarded as an adaptive aspect of the recuperative phase and not as a pathological effect.


The PDR model views pain as an element in a distinct motivational system. Thus there is a connection with ethological theory, which sees behaviour as a hierarchical structure of behavioural systems (l3)..These are separate motivational systems, each tuned to specific functions. Each commands a more or less extensive choice of behavioural routines and subroutines. When a particular system is activated, it inhibits other systems to a large extent, thus ensuring that its functional program can be executed without disturbance (unless a system with a much higher motivational urgency announces itself) (1).


The PDR conception has not remained undisputed (see the 'peer commentary' following the article). One objection is that fear really does increase pain sensitivity on occasion (think of the patient in the dentist's chair, cringing at the slightest touch). Then the acute, primary pain is feared. A refinement involving the distinction of primary and secondary pain is obviously needed (6). The model should be amended as follows: secondary pain generally inhibits fear and other motivations; and vice versa: strong other motivations can inhibit the perception of pain. However, the fearful expectation of a particular (primary?) pain heightens the sensitivity for that pain, and vice versa:such pain may generate fear of that pain (13).


### Functions of pain behaviour


With this model concerning the motivational structure of the pain system and its functional context in mind, we can investigate what behaviours are to be expected when the pain behaviour system is activated.

<ol>
  <li>The primary pain elicits immediate adaptive reactions, such as withdrawal and protective reflexes (e.g. a reflex-like attack on a nearby animal which might have been responsible for the pain, i.e. "pain-induced aggression"). Such vehement reactions can easily be recognized as indications of pain.</li>
  <li>In the subsequent recuperative phase, the response to secondary pain, can manifest itself in different ways:
    <ol type='a'>
      <li>The reprogramming of motor patterns to the effect that the damaged structures are spared. In principle such modifications (3.5. limping) are recognizable, and the veterinarian uses these to identify a source of pain</li>
      <li>Withdrawal to a secluded and safe place and abstinence from all but certain most urgent activities. Apathy, depressivity and unresponsiveness are mirrored in dejected movements and posture.</li>
    </ol>
    It is remarkable that depressivity is not recognized as easily as an indication of pain. In everyday life pain is associated primarily with the primary reflexes, such as cringing, and with specific emotional expressions, such as screaming, yelping and moaning.
  </li>

  <li>The latter form a functionally distinct class of pain indicators, because these are expression movements in the true sense. These are social signals, specifically evolved to inform others, in particular conspecifics, about the condition of the "sender". Whereas the condition of an animal can, in principle also be read from the behaviours of class 1 and 2, these are not "evolutionarily intended" to convey information. Since evolutionary theory tells us that signals will only evolve when the sender is benefitted by in— forming others about his state or intentions, the question rises what advantage an animal might have from informing others that it is suffering pain.</li>
</ol>







### Communication about pain


The expression of pain can have different social consequences:


<ol>
  <li>A cry of pain can, just as a cry of fear, alarm conspecifics and thus warn them for the danger; it can also help them to learn about the characteristics of possibly dangerous situations. Even if the sender can profit no more from this, natural selection will nevertheless favour the evolution of such signals, as long as relatives of the sender profit from these; according to kin selection theory, the 'inclusive fitness' of the sender will be benefitted by such 'altruistic' signal specialization (7, 11).</li>
<li>An animal may release support or consideration from its group members:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>These may come to defend a victim of an attack, either by a hostile conspecific or by a predator.</li>
    <li>During the recuperative phase some species give signals that originally belong to the infantile repertoire; these are signals of helplessness (such as yelping and moaning) that release parental protection and care. Although the documentation on this is still fragmentary, there are a few species in which even fully grown animals can release and receive such care. Thus dolphins carry sick or wounded herd members at the sea surf, just as mother and 'aunts' would do a newly born (22). There are exceptional examples of nearly adult handicapped monkeys in feral groups; their plaintive calls brought group members, especially near relatives, to collect them and carry them (2, 8). I saw hyenas in Masai Mara wait for a yelping pack member, limping behind, to catch up with them.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>


Clearly there are great differences between species in these respects.
Whether aid-seeking behaviours have evolved will depend on two factors:


1. Even simple forms of altruistic support will evolve rather in groups of
relatives (where kin-selection can operate) than in anonymous associations
such as a herd of wildebeest.
2. Extensive caregiving is to be expected in species which have developed
cooperative behaviours, for instance, in hunting and, above all, in brood
care. Such behaviour is to be expected in pack-living carnivores, such as
wolves and cape hunting dogs (cf.1h) rather than in antelopes.


Some species appear to be over-sensitive and touchy in comparison with others. Thus pigs cry blue murder when they get jammed. These are contact animals and, particularly for the piglets, an immediate and clear signal of pain is of great importance to prevent them from being squashed. The fact that a wildebeest remains mute while being torn to pieces by cape hunting dogs does not imply that it does not suffer from pain; during its evolution the living conditions may never have made it profitable to raise an outcry. So, expression movements of pain are closely linked to the possibility to provoke an adaptive social response. This is also demonstrated by the fact that the expression of pain seems to be dependent on the nature of the injury or disturbance. Thus animals such as horses and pigs remain mute when struck by internal affections, which we may assume to be painful on the basis of the 'postulate of homology' (I7).


### Concealing pain


Just as the possibility of help may promote the expression of pain, there may be circumstances promoting the inhibition of any sign that an animal is injured or ill and, therefore, vulnerable. Thus an animal in a threatened position of high rank might conceal strong suffering, lest its challengers notice it. If predators look for easy prey showing signs of weakness, then there must be a strong premium on concealment in such prey species. Systematic investigations of this aspect are still lacking, but anecdotal evidence suggests its importance.


### Social modulation of pain expression


Companion animals, such as dogs, are known to exaggerate fearful behaviour if it is reinforced, for instance, by much wanted attention (12). In an analogous manner the expression of pain, and secondarily, the selective awareness of pain, can be reinforced if this expression leads to positive social experience or to a relief from demands and obligations. In man much psycho
