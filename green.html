<p class="lead">Summary: I investigated a variety of possible pro-environment actions, and concluded that none of them were worth my time.</p>
</div>

<p>People often tell me I should care about the environment, and take steps to protect it. I'm on board with that in principle. However, before I spent a few hours researching this, I had no idea of how to judge how much environmental damage is caused by different things I'm doing, and which supposedly environmentally friendly measures I should bother taking.</p>
<p>For example, I'm aware that all the following things are costly to the environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>using water</li>
<li>using electricity</li>
<li>driving too much</li>
<li>purchasing plane tickets</li>
<li>not recycling glass</li>
<li>using lots of paper</li>
<li>throwing batteries into landfill</li>
<li>eating beef (this one's irrelevant to me because I'm vegan, but I know some people who don't eat beef for this reason)</li>
<li>donating to Cool Earth, which Katja Grace <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-11-14/less-burn-for-your-buck-part-ii">thinks</a> is the most cost effective way to reduce carbon emissions, at about $1.50 per tonne of CO2.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before I started researching this article, I had no idea how to weigh between these.</p>
<p>Central to my thoughts here is the Effective Altruism idea that we should try to use our time and effort in the most effective ways possible. I'm doing useful and fun things with my time, and I need to see some evidence for effectiveness of environmental choices before I can be convinced to displace my current behaviors. My time is worth about $40 an hour to me at the moment, and I don't want to take actions which aren't valuable enough to justify my time usage on them.</p>
<p>In particular, lots of these environmental concerns seem to just be normal economic issues. I'll talk about water consumption a bit more later, but it seems to me like a great example of an environmental issues which shouldn't really be considered as such. Water is a resource that I can choose to consume. I don't see any reasons why there would be large costs from my water consumption which don't factor into the price of water. I am totally on board with saving money by purchasing more efficient lighting for your dwellings, but that seems like a primarily practical matter rather than a moral one.</p>
<p>To me, the obvious comparison for enviromnentalism is veganism. When I choose not to eat a meal with 200g of chicken, I prevent (in expectation) <a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet">about four days</a> of suffering for a chicken in a factory farm. I don't get nearly enough pleasure out of eating that chicken to justify four days of confinement in a factory farm. It is very easy for me to make this calculation and become vegan.</p>
<p>But I have very little idea how to do a similar analysis for environmental issues. There are two main problems with trying to make that analysis.</p>
<p>Firstly, the causal relationship between my actions and environmental outcomes is a lot more subtle. </p>
<p>Second, I don't know which environmental issues I actually care about. I am convinced that I should worry about anthropogenic global warming, because GiveWell thinks it's probably dangerous enough to give thought to. However, I'm less sure about many other environmentalist issues.</p>
<p>I am not in general in favor of preserving ecosystems, because I'm worried about <a href="http://www.stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf">wild animal suffering</a>, and conservation is not an obvious way of improving wild animal lives. This means that I am unsure how to feel about deforestation, for example.</p>
<h2>Evaluations of particular issues</h2>
<h3>Conserving water</h3>
<p>Water usage is a great example. Australians hear a lot about our droughts, and how we should put in effort to conserve water. However, I'm not actually sure why I should care at all about my water consumption. Worries about droughts are often phrased in terms of people going thirsty, but as <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/californians-wont-go-thirsty">Jeff Kaufman points out</a>, this doesn't really make sense. In Australia, water costs consumers about <a href="file:///Users/buck2/Downloads/water-in-australia.pdf">$1 per tonne</a>. Desalinization costs about <a href="https://www.c-win.org/news/desalination-dramatically-increase-cost-water.html">$2.50 per tonne</a>. If we need to start getting water via desalinization plants, the increase in prices will only really be relevant to producers of extremely water intensive crops, and I see no compelling reason to care much about causing them a few cents of inconvenience with profligate water usage.</p>
<p>Maybe getting water to me requires enormous amounts of energy, and that has negative externalities because of climate change? Australian water requires about <a href="https://www.wsaa.asn.au/WSAAPublications/Documents/CSIRO%20WSAA%20Energy%20use%20in%20the%20consumption%20and%20provision%20of%20urban%20water%20in%20Australia.pdf">0.7 kWh/kL</a> to produce and pump to consumers. As we'll see in the next section, I don't think that this electricity consumption is enough of a problem to worry about.</p>

<h3>Reducing CO2 emissions</h3>
<p>Any measure which proposes to reduce my impact on climate change is going to need to be more effective than donating to Cool Earth, for $1.50 per tonne of CO2 prevented. Australians produce <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC">16.9 tonnes of C02 per capita per year</a>. (A plane trip to San Francisco creates about 2 tonnes of CO2, so maybe I'm more culpable than average?) Katja's research used the exchange rate of around 1600 tonnes of CO2 = 1 DALY averted. With that DALY figure, she thinks that marginal climate change reduction is not the most effective intervention for improving human life.</p>
<p>This immediately makes me extremely skeptical of the potential for me to make meaningful difference through personal action on climate change. If it took me an hour a year to reduce my CO2 emissions literally all the way to zero, that would not be worth my time: it would cost $25 to get Cool Earth to create the same effect, and I value my time at more than $25 per hour. </p>
<p>Also, I suspect that the externalities of electricity consumption are tiny compared to the selfish interest of reducing power bills. Consumer electricity costs about $0.40 per kWh. CO2 emissions from coal power plants are about 1kg per kWh (this varies wildly), which is about a millionth of a DALY. To put it another way, if I want to donate enough to Cool Earth to offset all of my personal electricity usage, I only need to give a dollar for every $300 I spend on power bills. That's small enough to be negligible.</p>
<p>It's probably nice to have that number for various other CO2 emitting activities we might be tempted by. Petrol creates about <a href="http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,163182&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL">2.6kg</a> of CO2 per liter used. (I was initially confused by that apparently conservation-of-energy-denying figure: it includes CO2 emitted in the production of the petrol.) Petrol costs about $1.50 per liter here in Canberra, so about 1.73 kg C02/$. So again, the ratio of personal cost to externality is about 1:500. Plane flights are similar: that 2 tonne plane ride to San Francisco cost me about $1200, so the ratio is 1:400.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I am not aware of any pro-environment action I can take which is worth my time. If you pay a little bit of attention to frugality, you're already doing as much for the environment as I think it is sensible to do.</p>
