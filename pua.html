<p>I've been trying to figure out a good explanation for the difference between dating advice (usually something I view as positive) and PUA-advice (which I view VERY negatively), and found this, which captures it well:
"This is about selling points more than debating specific pieces of advice. Yes, both dating advice and PUA might, for instance, suggest dressing better. But dating advice is about dressing better to be better, whereas it's packaged in PUA more like, "How to imitate the kind of assholes that get the chicks you rightfully deserve"."

<p><em>In response, someone else wrote the following comment, not all of which they endorse</em>:</p>
<p>Really? You really linked to that article? Clearly I haven't been going on enough diatribes about Principle of Charity recently.</p>
<p>[content warning: discussion of racism and fatphobia]</p>
<p>Consider by analogy an overweight black woman who can't get any dates because (as I gather from reading social justice blogs) these characteristics are considered unattractive. Whenever she complains about this, everyone says "Get a makeover and go on a diet." Whenever she tries this and it doesn't magically make her as attractive as everyone else in a short period of time, everyone tells her "Well, I guess you're just not trying hard enough and you don't really care and you don't deserve to be in a relationship. Just remember: whatever happens, the problem is you and your personal unworthiness."</p>
<p>At some point, this person might see all of her prettier friends happily pairing off. Maybe she's a brilliant mathematician - but her pretty friend who is barely literate and thinks Africa is a country gets paired off with the guy she had a crush on. Maybe she tries to be really nice and helpful to everyone - but her pretty friend who is a bully and likes pushing smaller girls into puddles gets paired off with the guy she's known since first grade and always imagined she would marry. Meanwhile, every time she asks a guy, he laughs in her face, and she has no idea why. This process continues all through middle school, high school, and college.</p>
<p>Then, every single time she raises the <em>slightest</em> bit of complaint about it - even just "I'm so sad and lonely, I wish I were dead", everyone turns on her and says "Oh, I see you're one of THOSE girls who thinks she's ENTITLED to sex because men just exist for your amusement". Every time she raises the hypothesis that maybe guys don't like black people, or fat people, everyone laughs at her and says "That attitude proves to me that you think you deserve sex, and THAT'S why guys don't like you, and they're RIGHT not to like you if you're that entitled!" If she talks about how depressing it is to see the guy she's been close to since first grade paired off with a bully who pushes smaller girls into puddles, they deliberately twist this to "Oh, so you think just because you've known him a while you OWN him! You're such a Nice Girl (TM)(R)"</p>
<p>And then one day she meets a group of social justice people who say "Yeah, guys tend to be kind of unfair about not dating overweight black girls. We acknowledge this problem and we're sorry your entire life up to this point has been heartbreaking and lonely. It doesn't mean you're a bad person, and we're not going to call you names or accuse you of horrible beliefs just because you're sad about it." And of COURSE she falls for them. Whether or not anything else they say makes sense.</p>
<p>I don't think it's true that girls only like jerks or bullies. I do think it's true that male attractiveness overwhelmingly requires something sort of but not exactly like social skills or popularity, to the point where people with every other good characteristic in the book who lack sort-of-like-social-skills-or-popularity will still get approximately zero dates ever. No particular rejection of any particular guy by any particular girl proves this, but I do think a statistical pattern emerges over a large number of rejections. It's the same as with the overweight black woman - she does not have the right to sex with any particular man, but generalized over almost no one wanting to have sex with her, she still has the right to conclude that men aren't valuing the same characteristics she thinks they should value.</p>
<p>I do not think that pickup artists are at all wrong to say that nice and intelligent people have fewer partners (or are more likely to have no partners). In high-schoolers, each extra IQ point increases chance of virginity by 2.7% for males and 1.7% by females. 87% of 19-year old US college students have had sex, yet only 65% of MIT <strong>graduate</strong> students have had sex. Studies with the Big Five find that men with low Agreeableness have the highest number of sexual partners and men with high Agreeableness the fewest. So "intelligent, nice men have more trouble getting girls" is AFAICT an objectively correct statement.</p>
<p>I guarantee you there is not a single man on the receiving end of this problem who has failed to notice it. When people are uncharitable jerks to them, that radicalizes them in favor of the only people who aren't, just as in the black woman example above.</p>
<p>(and this obviously does not imply "all girls are stupid and make terrible decisions" any more than the observed pattern of men not liking overweight black women as much implies that all men are stupid and make terrible decisions. It just implies that people have biases. Shock! Horror!)</p>
<p>I was going to say "I don't think anyone not on the receiving end of this problem understands how distressing and depressing a situation it is", but I guess it's pretty easy to explain now. It's the sort of distressing and depressing that leads you to the point where you shoot a bunch of people and then yourself. I mean, I didn't shoot a bunch of people, and I even mostly managed to avoid considering shooting myself, but I can sorta understand the depths that guy was coming from.</p>
<p>Hating on "nice guys" and "friend zoners" is like the <em>ultimate</em> form of punching down. Which I guess is why it's so popular.</p>
<p>And unfortuntely the only people these people find who are willing to give them the time of day rather than punch them down some more are these PUAs who talk about women as scum. I don't think this scum talk is out of some alien mutant misogyny. Remember, pickup artistry evolved - it's a collection of techniques that worked even if the users don't know why. I think this one works because the number one failure mode is being terrified of women. Like, I think I (used to?) have an unconscious belief that every single woman in the world is higher status than I am, and my guess is that this is a common problem among geeks. Talking down women as much as they can helps counteract this bias. If you've been told you're scum your entire life - and a lot of these people have, for exactly the reasons above - then telling themselves that women are also scum is like the only way they might consider themselves possibly worthy of a woman's love. (I think a lot of pickup artists are very explicit about this dynamic - see discussion of "putting pussy on a pedestal" and so on) But anyway, they do end out talking about women as scum, and that just makes everyone else feel totally justified in punching them down some more.</p>
<p>But everyone's collective decision to respond to people being upset about pickup artists by turning up the heat more and more on "nice guys" and "friend zoners" and "people who sometimes mention that being rejected every single day for ten years and not being loved or even smiled at by anyone ever has made them sad" is exactly the way to make the problem worse. It is entirely worthy of a country that thinks the solution to "some Afghans hate America" is "Well, let's bomb their houses and kill their families and see if that makes them hate us less."</p>
<p>In conclusion, <em>muffled sobs</em></p>
<p>Also, I would like to take a second to yell at the article for talking as if the shooter here was a central member of the pickup artist community. The shooter was a member of the PUAHate community, which, as the name implies, is about hating pickup artists. The writer's ability to distinguish among her supposed enemies is matched only by that of that one guy who massacred all those Sikhs because he was upset about Islam.</p>
