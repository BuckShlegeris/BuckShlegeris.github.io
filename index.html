                <div class="lead">
                <p>I'm a computer scientist, musician, and aspiring effective altruist from Australia, currently living in San Francisco.</p>

                <p>I spent the first half of 2014 in San Francisco, working at <a href="http://www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a>, a coding bootcamp. I'm currently the first and only employee at <a href="https://triplebyte.com">Triplebyte</a>, a company which is working on improving the interview process for software engineers.</p>

                <p>I make fun music like <a href="http://soundcloud.com/buckmbs" target="_blank">this</a>.
                </div>




            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

            <p>I studied computer science and physics at the Australian National University for two years. At the end of 2013, after completing enough courses to get a computer science major, I moved to San Francisco for App Academy. After the nine week course, App Academy offered me a job teaching the course I'd just done. I worked there until returning to Australia for university in June. You can read an interview I did about App Academy <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Now, I'm in SF after finishing my degree. I worked for PayPal in Scala, then left to work at Triplebyte.</p>

            <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

            <p>My favorite parts of computer science have shifted a lot over the years. I'm really excited about front end web development at the moment, but in the past I've been more interested in data structures. I also love functional programming, programming language implementation, and computer systems stuff.<p>

            <p>One of my most interesting programming projects is an effort to automatically choose fast data structures, given a description of the API they need to support. You can see my efforts on <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview">GitHub</a>, or in this talk I gave at Scala By The Bay 2015:</p>

            <p>More entertainingly, you can play <a href="./music-game">this game</a> which I made to practise relative pitch.</p>

            <h2 id="music">Music</h2>

            <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rtrO5w3IsQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>I write songs and used to play them with my band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bucketal">Buck et al</a> in Canberra.</p>

            <!-- <hr class="bs-docs-separator"> -->

            <h2 id="effective-altruism">Effective altruism</h2>

            <p>I want to use my career to help the world. I am currently trying to do that by maximising my income and then donating as much money as I can. This strategy is known as <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">earning to give</a>.</p>

            <p>I'm part of the effective altruism movement, which has sprung up in recent years around organizations like <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> (of which I am a member), <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Center for Effective Altruism</a>.</p>

            <p>I regularly attend the Stanford effective altruism meetups.</p>

            <p>I was on a panel at EA Global in Mountain View in 2015.</p>

            <h3 id="donations">Donation history</h3>

            <p>Since I started working, I've donated $48560.</p>

            <p>In 2014, I donated about 10% of my income. In 2015, I donated about 30%. Here's a complete record:</p>

            <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
            <tr>
                <th>Date</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>11 July 2014</td>
                <td>$4000</td>
                <td>Animal Charity Evaluators</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>23 October 2014</td>
                <td>$1000</td>
                <td>Animal Charity Evaluators</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5 September 2015</td>
                <td>$2500</td>
                <td>Machine Intelligence Research Institute</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>31 December 2015</td>
                <td>$40,000</td>
                <td>my donor-advised fund</td>
            </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                I donated to a donor-advised fund at the end of 2015, because I was unsure about
                where I should donate. I will hopefully donate this money during January.
