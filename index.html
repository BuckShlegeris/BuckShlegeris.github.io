                <p>I'm a web developer, musician, and effective altruist from Australia, living in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>Currently, I work at <a href="http://www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a>, a coding bootcamp.</p>

            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

            <p>I studied computer science and physics at the Australian National University for two years. At the end of 2012, after completing enough courses to get a computer science major, I moved to San Francisco for App Academy. After the nine week course, App Academy offered me a job teaching the course I'd just done. I've been happily working there since then. You can read an interview I did about App Academy <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy">here</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
            <p>My particular intrests in programming are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> I've written software for <a href="#gem">physics</a> and <a href="#submissionapp">computer science</a> education, and work teaching web development.</li>
                <li><strong>Functional programming and static typing:</strong> I used to teach Haskell, and presented on <a href="#algebraic">some theoretical properties of it.</a> I love static typing, and desperately miss it in the scripting languages I end up using most of the time.</li>
                <li><strong>User interface design</strong> I really enjoy designing novel user interfaces, as I did in my <a href="#gem">GEM</a> project.</li>

            <p>I wrote an as-yet-unnamed submission app for my university. It's currently being used in the <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp1100/">Intro to Programming and Algorithms</a> course. It's in Rails, with some shell scripting.</p>
            <p>It has a variety of nifty features, including support for automatic compilation, test cases, and grading.</p>
            <p>I am enthusiastic about the prospect of developing this software into the future, and modifying it for the use of other courses which want it.</p>



            <h3 id="gem">Graphical Equation Manipulator</h3>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>GEM is physics software to intuitively manipulate equations. It was my one adventure in the world of UX. It was fun to do something more directly focussed on people than the programs I usually work on.</p>
            <p>I invented the concept and wrote a Python prototype. With my supervisor <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/physics/Savage/">Craig Savage</a>, I ran user studies on it, and found evidence of its effectiveness. After securing some funding, I supervised and assisted <a href="http://matthewja.com">Matt Alger</a> as he ported the software to a Coffeescript web app. We're still working on finishing that and doing more user studies.</p>
            <p>Along the way, Matt and I wrote <a href="http://matthewja.com/Coffeequate/">Coffeequate</a>, currently the best Javascript computer algebra system on the market. We just need to give it a few upgrades before we can release a v1.0.</p>


            <h3 id="compiler"><a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/rpeanut-compiler">rPeANUt compiler</a></h3>

            <p><a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2300/rpeanut.html">rPeANUt</a> is a simulated microprocessor which ANU uses to teach assembly programming. I'm writing a compiler in Scala from a bastardized subset of C to the rPeANUt assembly language. For example, it compiles <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/rpeanut-compiler/blob/master/examples/simple.c">this</a> to <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/rpeanut-compiler/blob/master/examples/simple.s">this</a>.</p>

            <p>One of the main goals of this project was to teach myself Scala, and I've really enjoyed using it. It's a lovely language: I really missed strong typing when I was mostly writing Ruby.</p>

            <p>I'll probably rewrite the backend to target a real microprocessor sometime.</p>


            <h3 id="other-coding">Other small, interesting projects</h3>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/ZipClassifier">Zip classifier</a></h4>
            <p>In a fit of frustration after spending about eight hours trying to install <a href="http://www.complearn.org/">CompLearn</a> on a variety of operating systems, I reimplemented the backend functionality one night in Python. It does cool things like reproducing phylogenetic trees based on the DNA sequences of various mammals.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/TISE_flux_solver">TISE flux solver</a></h4>
            <p>I wrote a program which takes stepwise potential functions and solves the time-independent Schroedinger equation for a particle flux over them. This lets us do fun things like view the transmission amplitude of a finite square well as a function of particle frequency.</p>

            <h4>Brute force approximation of Solomonoff prior</h4>
            <p>The Solomonoff prior is a probability distribution over binary strings. So for example, if you know you're going to see a string, "000" seems more likely than "101100100110100101": Solomonoff's prior formalises that. It (sort of) defines the prior of a string as the proportion of Turing machines which output that string, with simple TMs having higher weight. This is incomputable, because of the halting problem.</p>
            <p>However, that didn't stop me from writing a Python script which generated random Turing machines and ran them for ages, then saved their output to a file. I ran this script on about twenty computers overnight, then collated the result of the trillion trials into one file which I then could use for sequence prediction. It correctly predicted things like the next character in the sequence "01010101". Tragically, I've lost that output file.</p>
            <p>I've rewritten my Turing machine simulator in C++, and now it's much faster. Pretty soon, I'll recreate all the data I lost.</p>

            <h4>Data structures stuff</h4>
            <p>We can use a mathematical tool called generating functions to analyse the behavior of data structures. I presented on this at a student conference. I wrote a short script for the project: my code, and an explanation, are available <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/DataStructuresStuff">here</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="effective-altruism">Effective altruism</h2>
            <p>I want to use my career to help the world. For someone like me, the best way to do that is probably trying to maximise my income and then spending my money on useful things. This strategy is known as <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">earning to give</a>.</p>

            <p>I'm part of the Effective Altruist movement, which has sprung up in recent years around organizations like <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href="http://givewell.org">Givewell</a>, and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Center for Effective Altruism</a>.</p>

            <p>I am very lucky to have had so many strokes of good fortune in my place and time of birth. Making the world better for those less fortunate is the least I can do.</p>

            <p>I'm particularly interested in moral concerns with animal suffering, particularly wild animal suffering, and the far future.</p>

            <p>You can see many of my thoughts about this on my <a href="http://bshlgrs.tumblr.com">blog</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>

            <p>It's good to talk publicly about your donations, because people start to think of donating to effective charities as the normal thing to do. So in the spirit of <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/make-your-giving-public">Jeff Kaufman</a> and <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/330050.html">Scott Alexander</a>, I'm publicly stating my donations.</p>

            <p>I started working in January 2014, and I'm going back to uni in July. Since then, I have given $5060, which is only a bit more than 10% of my income over that time. When my life gets a bit more stable, I'll be able to give more than that.</p>
