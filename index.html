                <div class="lead">
                <p>I'm a computer scientist, musician, and effective altruist from Australia, currently living in San Francisco.</p>

                <p>I spent the first half of 2014 in San Francisco, working at <a href="http://www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a>, a coding bootcamp. I currently work as a software engineer at Paypal in SOMA, building distributed systems in Scala.</p>

                <p>I make fun music like <a href="http://soundcloud.com/buckmbs" target="_blank">this</a>.
                </div>

            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

            <p>I studied computer science and physics at the Australian National University for two years. At the end of 2013, after completing enough courses to get a computer science major, I moved to San Francisco for App Academy. After the nine week course, App Academy offered me a job teaching the course I'd just done. I worked there until returning to Australia for university in June. You can read an interview I did about App Academy <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Now, I'm in SF after finishing my degree. I work for PayPal in Scala.</p>

            <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
           
            <p>My most interesting programming project is an effort to automatically choose fast data structures, given a description of the API they need to support. You can see my efforts on <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview">GitHub</a>. I gave a talk on this at Scala By The Bay 2015; I'll add a link to the video when it's released.</p>

            <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rtrO5w3IsQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>I write songs and used to play them with my band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bucketal">Buck et al</a> in Canberra.</p>

            <h2 id="effective-altruism">Effective altruism</h2>
            <p>I want to use my career to help the world. I am currently trying to do that by maximising my income and then donating as much money as I can. This strategy is known as <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">earning to give</a>.</p>

            <p>I'm part of the Effective Altruist movement, which has sprung up in recent years around organizations like <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> (of which I am a member), <a href="http://givewell.org">Givewell</a>, and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Center for Effective Altruism</a>.</p>

            <p>You can see many of my thoughts about this on my <a href="http://bshlgrs.tumblr.com">blog</a>.</p>

            <p>I was on a panel at EA Global in Mountain View in 2015.</p>

            <h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>

            <p>It's good to talk publicly about your donations, because people start to think of donating to effective charities as the normal thing to do. So in the spirit of <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/make-your-giving-public">Jeff Kaufman</a> and <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/330050.html">Scott Alexander</a>, I'm publicly stating my donations.</p>

            <p>I worked full time January to July 2014, and part time until November 2014. Over that time, I donated USD$6060, which was only a bit more than 10% of my income over that time.</p>

            <p>I haven't donated yet in 2015, but I plant to give about USD$45,000 this year.</p>
