## Stuff I know.

- __Software engineering.__ I've written ten thousand lines of bad code, and ten thousand lines of better code. I know Python, Ruby, Javascript and C properly.
    - I'm pretty proud of the [compiler](https://github.com/bshlgrs/rpeanut-compiler) I wrote for fun in Scala.
    - I did a research project on a novel application of deep learning to reinforcement learning.
    -  I'm particularly interested in [programming language theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB73WLf1k9c) and operating systems.
    -  A friend and I built the best [open source Javascript computer algebra system](matthewja.com/Coffeequate/) currently available.
- __Web development.__
    - I studied at [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/), and worked there teaching web development.
    - I built a new submission management system for my CS department.
    - For fun, I made a [better timetable builder](https://www.facebook.com/groups/168771733252125/permalink/531557520306876/) for my university.
- __Education.__
    -  I worked at App Academy for six months, and loved the innovative teaching environment there.
    -  I'm the only person who has TA'd all three of the first year programming courses at ANU (teaching Python, Java, and Haskell).
    -  I concieved, designed, built, and experimented with a novel physics education software system.
