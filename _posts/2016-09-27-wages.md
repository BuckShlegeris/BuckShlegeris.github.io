title:  "Two claims about labor economics which I didn't realize are contradictory"

Here are two claims you could make about the market for unskilled labor:

- Increasing the minimum wage won't decrease employment among unskilled workers.
- Unskilled immigrants don't reduce wages for unskilled natives.

I recently saw someone point out that these can't both be true, because they imply opposite things about the shape of the demand curve.

Here's a diagram of a world where the first claim is true:

So the minumum wage was P1, then it got increased to P2. This slightly decreased the number of jobs (from Q1 to Q2), but not by very much.

This means that the demand curve for low-wage employment is [inelastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand).

What would things look like if the second claim were true--that unskilled immigrants don't reduce wages for unskilled natives?

In this situation, we had a bunch of immigration, and this increased the quantity of low-skilled labor available from Q1 to Q2. (This could be represented as a shift in the supply curve, but representing it as just a shift in quantity works fine for our purposes.) This resulted in only a small decrease in wages, from P1 to P2.

If this is true, then the demand curve is highly elastic!

So these claims, interpreted naively, are contradictory.

I understand this now that someone has pointed it out, but I definitely didn't think of it on my own. I want to notice this kind of thing automatically, just like I automatically notice the discrepancy when someone tells me that an investment is unusually high-return and also low-risk.

I think the reason that I didn't notice this is that one of the claims involves an increase in price, and the other involves an increase in quantity. So here is an enumeration of all the different things that it means for demand to be elastic, like it was in the immigration case above:

- If price increases, quantity decreases a lot.
- If price decreases, quantity increases a lot.
- If quantity increases, price decreases a bit.
- If quantity decreases, price increases a bit.

And if demand is inelastic:

- If price increases, quantity decreases a bit.
- If price decreases, quantity increases a bit.
- If quantity increases, price decreases a lot.
- If quantity decreases, price increases a lot.

The obvious next step is to make an app which makes me practice quickly translating those descriptions and elasticity levels. It's on my to-do list.
