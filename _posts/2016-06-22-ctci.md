[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) is by far the most popular interview prep book for software engineers. But it was written for a few years ago, and software engineering interviews seem to have changed in the meantime, at least in the Silicon Valley engineering culture which I'm most involved in.

I think [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) has a slightly better selection of content. And its content is more engagingly presented. But it's also a shit ton more expensive, and it doesn't actually contain many questions which aren't in CtCI.

So I've collated this reading guide for CtCI.

## General notes

Every chapter in the interview questions section of CtCI starts with a short summary of the subject matter for the questions. I think these notes are quite good. It's well worth reading the notes for chapters even if you don't do questions from them.

The first 40-ish pages of the book are general advice about software engineering interviews. I agree with all of it except the following points, organized by section:

**Before the interview**: Companies don't ask behavioral questions much.

**What You Need To Know (page 26)**: Tries are not absolutely must-have knowledge. I've never heard of people being asked to implement quicksort in place. Singleton and Factory design patterns are not crucial knowledge.

**At the Interview**: You don't have to use C, C++, or Java. People will possibly be biased against you if you do. Ruby, Python, and Javascript are fine choices. I think it's fine to do the problem in whatever language you want. You can ask your recruiter about this before the interview.

## The most relevant questions

Here is a subset of the questions which I think reflects SF software interviews more accurately:

1.1, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.8, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.2, 9.3, 9.6, 12.1, 12.2, 12.6, 12.7, 15.3, 17.5, 18.1, 18.2, 19.2, 19.7, 19.11, 20.10, 20.11.

I would recommend giving these questions higher priority in your study.

## Comments on individual question chapters:

### Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

Companies care less about seeing you edit data in place than they used to. I'd only expect questions on this if you're applying for a C job. For this reason, questions [1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7] are lower priority.

### Chapter 2: Linked Lists

All of these questions are less common these days because linked lists come up less because we don't use C as much.

[Fuck question 2.2.](http://bshlgrs.github.io/2016/04/22/dumbest-algorithm-problem.html)

2.5 is a common bullshit brainteaser question.

### Chapter 3: Queues and stacks

I agree that you'll look good if you can flawlessly implement a queue and stack.

### Chapter 4: Graphs and trees

Study BFS, it's a really common question.

### Chapter 5: Bit manipulation

I've rarely seen these problems come up, even when I interviewed for a C++ systems job.

### Chapter 6: Brainteasers

These questions are widely reviled, and seem to be getting less common. Maybe memorize the answers in case you run across a bad interviewer.

### Chapter 7: OOP

These questions are good. The provided answers are idiomatic Java; if you're answering in Python you should model your answers after idiomatic Python rather than the answers given.

I don't hear about people being asked abstract questions like 7.3.

### Chapter 8: Recursion

Many of these questions are classics which I've been asked many times before.

### Chapter 9: Searching and sorting

I think that it's somewhat less common to be asked to write sorting algorithms these days.

### Chapter 10: Math

I don't hear about math questions being asked, except at extremely math heavy companies to applicants with a hardcore math background.

### Chapter 11: testing

I don't hear about these questions very much. I've never heard questions like "how would you test a pen".

### Chapter 12: system design and memory limits

I don't hear about memory limit questions very often.

### Chapter 13 and 14: C++ and Java

Only relevant if you're interviewing in C++ or Java, and even then I'd be slightly surprised to get these questions.

### Chapter 15: Databases

The advice given is somewhat out of date. I don't think that I've ever heard about someone being asked to denormalize their SQL database schema for speed.

I think the "design a database to hold certain data" type questions are more common now. The rise of ORMs has led to SQL being somewhat less important for most developers.

### Chapter 16: Low level

These questions are great, but I wouldn't expect them at most generalist job interviews.

### Chapter 17: Networking

This is somewhat more low level than I think most people get asked. It's worth knowing the answer to the famous "what happens after you type a URL into a browser" question though.

### Chapter 18: Threads and Locks

Companies don't seem to ask about concurrency primitives without warning you beforehand. Some of these questions are Java-specific.

### Chapter 19 and 20: Moderate and Hard

All these questions are popular questions. I don't particularly like them.
