[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) is by far the most popular interview prep book for software engineers. But it was written for a few years ago, and software engineering interviews seem to have changed in the meantime, at least in the Silicon Valley engineering culture which I'm most involved in.

I think [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) has content which is more relevant to the software engineering interviews I hear about. And its content is more engagingly presented. But it's also a shit ton more expensive, and much shorter.

So I've collated this reading guide for CtCI.

## General notes

Every chapter starts with a bunch of notes on the subject which it's testing. I think these notes are quite good. It's well worth reading the notes for chapters even if you don't do questions from them.

The first 40-ish pages of the book are general advice about software engineering interviews. I agree with all of it except the following points, organized by section:

**Before the interview**: Companies don't ask behavioral questions much.

**What You Need To Know (page 26)**: Tries are not absolutely must-have knowledge. I've never heard of people being asked to implement quicksort in place. Singleton and Factory design patterns are not crucial knowledge.

**At the Interview**: You don't have to use C, C++, or Java. People will possibly be biased against you if you do. Ruby, Python, and Javascript are fine choices. I think it's fine to do the problem in whatever language you want. You can ask your recruiter about this before the interview.

## Comments on the questions:

Here is a subset of the questions which I think reflects SF software interviews more accurately:

1.1, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.8, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.2, 9.3, 9.6, 12.1, 12.2, 12.6, 12.7, 15.3, 17.5, 18.1, 18.2, 19.2, 19.7, 19.11, 20.10, 20.11.

### Chapter 1

Companies care less about seeing you edit data in place than they used to. I'd only expect questions on this if you're applying for a C job. For this reason, questions [1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7] are lower priority.

### Chapter 2

All of these questions are less common these days because linked lists come up less because we don't use C as much.

[Fuck question 2.2.](http://bshlgrs.github.io/2016/04/22/dumbest-algorithm-problem.html)

2.5 is a common bullshit brainteaser question.

### Chapter 3

I agree that you'll look good if you can flawlessly implement a queue and stack.

### Chapter 4

### Chapter 5

I've rarely seen these problems come up, even when I interviewed for a C++ systems job.

### Chapter 6

These questions are widely reviled, and seem to be getting less common.

### Chapter 7

These questions are good. The provided answers are idiomatic Java; if you're answering in Python you should model your answers after idiomatic Python rather than the answers given.
