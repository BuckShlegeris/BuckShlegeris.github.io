title:  "How much of a paperclip maximizer's resources should be spend on research?"

Suppose you're a paperclip maximizer who has just finished exterminating humanity. You want to build as many paperclips as you can. This involves two activities: researching how to build paperclips as efficiently as possible, and then executing on the optimal manufacturing technique that you've discovered.

Research has diminishing marginal returns. When I started thinking about this, my guess was that the proportion of your effort you'd spend on research would decrease quickly as you increased the amount of resources you control.

But then I tried making a mathematical model for it and now I don't think that anymore.

## Logarithmic returns

Suppose the returns to thinking are logarithmic. Maybe the cost of manufacturing a paperclip after you've expended $$r$$ effort on researching paperclip manufacturing is $$\frac{1}{\log(r)}$$. Now if you have $$x$$ total resources, the total paperclip manufacture you get done is

$^$\frac{x - r}{\log(r)}$^$

which you can solve to get the optimal value of $$r$$ (full working [here](https://github.com/bshlgrs/economics-demos/blob/master/python/paperclip.py)):

$^$ e^{\operatorname{LambertW}{\left (e \cdot x \right )} - 1} $^$

Not gonna lie, I had to look up what the Lambert W function is. It's asymptotially equal to $$\log(x) - \log(\log(x)) + o(1)$$. So overall we have

$$\begin{align}
   e^{\operatorname{LambertW}{\left (e \cdot x \right )} - 1} &= e^{\log(e \cdot x) - \log(\log(e \cdot x)) + o(1) - 1} \\
 &= \frac{e \cdot x}{\log(e \cdot x)} \cdot o(1)
\end{align}$$

So the proportion of energy dedicated to research increases like $$\frac{x}{\log(x)}$$.

Here's a table of some values of the solution:

## Other functional forms for returns to research

If returns diminish more slowly than logarithmically, eg if your cost function is $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}$$, you end up spending a larger fraction of your resources on research--in that particular case, you spend exactly $$\frac13$$ on research. More generally, the cost function $$\frac{1}{\sqrt[p]{r}}$$ has an optimal research expenditure of $$\frac{1}{p + 1}\cdot x$$.

If returns diminish more quickly than logarithmically, you spend less on research. But not that much. I can't find a closed form solution for the case where paperclip cost looks like $$frac{1}{\log(\log(r))}$$, but when I [solve it numerically](https://github.com/bshlgrs/economics-demos/blob/master/python/paperclip_log_log.py), research expenditure looks only slightly slower growing than it was in the log case.

## Could returns to research ever hit literally zero?

I don't see any obvious reasons that they would, but I guess it could happen. Even if they did, you'd have to be extremely confident that you were never going to get anything useful out of research in order to stop doing it.

## Conclusion

Given that research spending is a reasonably large proportion of industry now, and that research looks like it should grow almost proportionally with your overall resource budget even when you have extremely large amounts of resources, I think that a paperclipper would probably continue to spend a noticeable proportion of its resources on optimizing its existing processes.
