I made a tool for visualizing the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient of a population. You can see it [here](http://shlegeris.com/gini). (The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality in a distribution; it's the most way of quantifying income inequality)

Playing with it has significantly improved my intuitions about how much inequality different Gini coefficients really correspond to.

If you don't currently know the Gini coefficient of US incomes, then I think it might be an interesting experience to use this tool to try to guess it. Try to type in your best guess as to the US income distribution and see if you overestimated or underestimated the amount of inequality.
