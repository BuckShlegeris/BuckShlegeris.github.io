There’s an old dumb objection to effective altruism, nicely summarized by [Ben Kuhn’s story](http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6i/ben_kuhn_on_the_effective_altruist_movement/) of the first time that he ran across what would become the EA movement:

> When I was a sophomore in high school (that's age 15 for non-Americans), Peter Singer gave his The Life You Can Save talk at my high school. He went through his whole "child drowning in the pond" spiel and explained that we were morally obligated to give money to charities that helped those who were worse off than us. In particular, I think at that point he was recommending donating to Oxfam in a sort of Kantian way where you gave an amount of money such that if everyone gave the same percentage it would eliminate world poverty. My friends and I realized that there was no utilitarian reason to stop at that amount of money--you should just donate everything that you didn't need to survive.
> So, being not only sophomores but also sophomoric, we decided that since Prof. Singer didn't live in a cardboard box and wear only burlap sacks, he must be a hypocrite and therefore not worth paying attention to.

This objection is kind of silly: Peter Singer almost certainly does more good with his current attire than he'd do living in a cardboard box and wearing burlap sacks.

But I worry that this objection is weak enough that it has a [cowpox-of-doubt](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/)-like effect on our ability to seriously consider the stronger version of this argument: that many of us could be doing more, and we don't really have a principled excuse not to.

For example. I don't think that I could use my money that much more effectively. My personal expenses (excluding eg things I bought for other people) totalled something like $30 to $35k last year, and looking back on it I think that all of that was very well spent. I did a bunch of things with my spare time last year which I think were super valuable for me: I did a [conference presentation](https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview) which made me a significantly better programmer, I did some other programming side-projects which taught me some skills which ended up being relevant to my current job, and I spent some time thinking about how to trade off [saving lives vs improving them](http://bshlgrs.github.io/2015/08/08/value-of-life.html), which made me somewhat better at reasoning about
