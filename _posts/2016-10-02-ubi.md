Sometimes people say that a universal basic income would be good, because unlike the current welfare system which phases out benefits as your income increases, imposing an effective high marginal tax rate, the UBI stays as your income rises. As a result, these people claim, the UBI does not disincentivise work.

This is false. Suppose a worker's utility function is

$$\text{utility} = \log(\text{wage} \cdot \text{tax rate} \cdot \text{hours worked} + \text{UBI}) - \text{hours worked}$$

Increasing the UBI decreases the marginal utility of hours worked, because of diminishing marginal returns. So the UBI discourages work.

Here's a proper mathematical proof. Let the wage be $l w$, tax rate $l 1 - r$, hours worked $l h$, UBI $l c$. Assume flat tax for simplicity. So $l U = \log(w \cdot h \cdot r + c) - h$. The optimal amount of work happens when $l \frac{dU}{dh}$ is zero.

$$\begin{align}
  0 &= \frac{dU}{dh} \\
    &= \frac{r \cdot w}{c + h \cdot r \cdot w} - 1 \\
  r \cdot w &= c + h \cdot r \cdot w \\
  r \cdot w - c &= h \cdot r \cdot w \\
  h &= \frac{r \cdot w - c}{r \cdot w}
\end{align}$$

So increasing the UBI decreases hours worked, and the effect is stronger if your wage is lower.
