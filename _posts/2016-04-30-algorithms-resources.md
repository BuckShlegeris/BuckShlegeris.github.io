Here are my recommendations for good materials on algorithms.

## Textbooks

My favorite textbook on algorithms is **The Algorithm Design Manual**, by Steven Skiena.



## Other resources

### [The International Olympiad in Informatics Syllabus](https://people.ksp.sk/~misof/ioi-syllabus/)

This has a great list of topics in algorithms and data structures (and general discrete math).
