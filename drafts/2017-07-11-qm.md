I just ran across an interesting and confusing thing in quantum mechanics.

EDIT: I now know what my mistake was, thanks to [Physics Stack Exchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/345280/128124).

## Part 1: an alleged theorem

Suppose $$V_1$$ and $$V_2$$ are potential functions, and for all $$x$$, $$V_1(x) \leq V_2(x)$$. So $$V_2$$ is higher everywhere.

Let $$\psi_1$$ and $$\psi_2$$ be the ground state wavefunctions of $$V_1$$ and $$V_2$$ respectively, with energies $$E_1$$ and $$E_2$$.

**Alleged theorem:** $$E_1 \leq E_2$$

*Proof*: Imagine transplanting the wavefunction from $$V_2$$ into the other potential. Its energy (which we can call $$E_3$$) is going to be smaller than or equal to $$E_2$$. And this is an upper bound on $$E_1$$, by the variational principle. So $$E_3 \leq E_2$$ and $$E_1 \leq E_3$$, therefore $$E_1 \leq E_2$$.

This theorem seems intuitive enough--if you increase the potential, the ground state shouldn't lower its energy.

## Part 2: square wells

Consider the potential function which is infinity everywhere, except that it's 0 between 0 and 1, and it's 1000 between 1 and 2.

What's the ground state energy $$E$$ of this well? I claim it's at least 1000.

We can't have $$E$$ less than 0, because that's the lowest value of potential anywhere. (This theorem is Problem 2.2 in Griffiths; it's true because if $$E < V_{min}$$ then $$\psi$$ and its second derivative have the same sign everywhere, which means that the wavefunction can't be normalized.)

Now let's consider the possibility of $$0 < E < 1000$$. The wavefunction will be oscillating on the left and exponentially decaying on the right, because when potential is constant, the solution to the Schrodinger equation is sinusoidal where $$E > V$$ and exponential where $$E < V$$ (eg see [these notes](http://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph130a/130_notes/node129.html)).

The right section of the wavefunction can't just be zero, because the wavefunction has to be twice continuous and a sine wave never has zero value and zero derivative at the same time. So there has to be non-trivial exponential decay on the right. This violates the boundary conditions, because exponential decay can never get to zero.

Therefore, the energy of the wavefunction has to be greater than 1000. This is greater than the ground state energy of the normal infinite square well. Because $$\infty > 1000$$, this is a counterexample to my earlier alleged theorem.

I am pretty sure that the problem here is with the claim that $$E > 1000$$ in that well. To resolve this, I'm going to read the solution to the finite well again, and in particular I'm going to look at the behavior as the well depth approaches infinity.

EDIT: I tried that and I'm still confused. I feel like there are definitely wavefunctions for my weird well which have less energy than 1000, which means that my analysis is wrong somehow.

EDIT 2: Someone on StackOverflow [figured out my mistake](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/345280/128124).
