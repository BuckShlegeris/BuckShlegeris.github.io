One personality trait that seems to influence whether you like effective altruism is your attitude towards tradeoffs. Some people seem to be naturally disinclined to thinking about opportunity costs. They don't find it natural to think that the best option you have might have downsides. This comes up most often when you’re talking about why cause neutrality and cause prioritization are important—some people just don’t seem to get it.

I used to think that effective altruism just selected against people who aren’t inclined to think this way. But I think the effect is stronger than that: I think we actively attract people who find moral tradeoffs fascinating and deeply satisfying.

I find it really cathartic to read Scott Alexander’s modest proposal. We compliment people on their bullet biting, which is like a tradeoff in a lot of ways. One of the founding posts of rationalism is http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/.

To some extent this is probably just because the refusal to acknowledge tradeoffs is really annoying, and it’s a refreshing change to see them mentioned. Explicit discussion of tradeoffs makes an argument seem like it was written by someone smart.

Also acknowledging tradeoffs lets you be edgy.

There are a whole bunch of policy proposals which I think I’m probably biased towards because they naturally include explicit discussion of tradeoffs. Eg FDA, minimum wage, blah blah blah.

I think I am often too inclined to mention the tradeoffs of my beliefs early when I talk to people; I think this is a not-particularly-reasonable bias which I should probably correct.

OTOH, cluster thinking
