title:  "Take morals seriously"

I really hate it when I’m talking about something which I think is incredibly morally important, and the person I’m talking to treats it like a joke and feels no sympathy for the strength of my conviction. (Feminists have written a bunch of articles about how annoying they find it when privileged people "play devil’s advocate" in this way.) They give me a shitty argument that I carefully and honestly try to respond to in good faith, and as soon as I’m done they move on to the next objection. And then at the end they say that they were just kidding and they actually don’t care at all about what I was talking about.

Ironically, the person who has most upset me in this way was the white dude who originally shared this post. One time I was saying that I thought that it was terribly wrong to torture animals to eat animal products. He asked me why I was using an Apple product if I cared so much about ethics of consumption. I told him I wasn’t sure what he meant.

He told me that conditions in Apple factories were notoriously terrible. He said that the suicide rates were so high in Apple factories in China that they had to put nets up next to the roofs to stop people jumping off. He said that if I really cared about ethics, I should go look into that.

So I did—I had a lot of respect for the guy and I thought of him as my friend, so I wanted to take his sincere moral claims seriously. I went to my computer and diligently looked into it. After an hour, I was pretty sure that he was wrong. I’d looked into conditions, and I’d thought about opportunity costs, and I’d thought about how many hours of factory worker time probably happen as the result of each MacBook purchased, and overall I thought it added up to not mattering or being slightly positive.

I went to the guy to tell him this. He told me that he didn’t care and didn’t want to talk about it. I was quite taken aback—I said that he’d told me that I should look into something, and I thought it was only reasonable of me to talk to him about what I’d found. His friend scolded me for trying to pressure him into talking about something that he didn’t want to talk about; a few years later, she saw the post which I’m writing about and commented how much she agreed with it.

(For what it’s worth, he ended up slightly apologizing for this, at my prompting, a few weeks later.)

(I’d normally message someone to tell them that I was writing a post about them. But in this case, I think the person in question has clearly communicated his preference against seeing calmly written disagreements, and I see no reason not to do what he seems to want.)
