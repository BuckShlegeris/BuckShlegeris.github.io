[epistemic status: I'm like 90% confident in my claim about water. It's possible I have other details wrong here.]

[edit: **I think the core claim here is wrong. I'll update as I get more convinced.**]

At room temperature, almost none of the water molecules in a glass of water are bending or stretching at all--they bounce around with their bonds almost totally rigid. In general, it takes more energy to make a molecule stretch or bend than molecules typically have at room temperature.

Water can bend and stretch and it looks like this:

But the energy for these modes is high enough that water molecules are almost never in them at room temperature.

Here's my working: [This set of course notes](http://chemistry.ncssm.edu/watervibCS.pdf) claims that the lowest frequency vibration of water has a wavenumber of $$1766.99 \text{cm}^{-1}$$. This [converts to](http://physics.shlegeris.com/notepads/19) $$3.512\cdot 10^{-20}\text{J}$$. If you plug this into the Boltzmann equation, you [see](https://www.google.com/search?q=exp(-3.5e-20%20joules%20/%20(boltzmann%20constant%20*%20293%20kelvin))) that the state where the molecule is vibrating is about 6000 times less common than the state where it isn't. So almost all of the amplitude of your water molecules is in states with no vibration. [This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy_correlation_table) contains the absorption peaks for a bunch of other types of molecular bond; those wavenumbers are similar to the one I converted above.

That there's a similar lack of movement among the electrons. The energy of the excited electron states in a molecule is around 10x higher than the energy of a vibrational mode, so they're even less likely to be out of their ground states. So your molecules bounce around with their electrons barely jostling at all.

As molecules bounce into each other, I think that their electrons adiabatically shift into the lowest energy states available for the perturbed potential energy field they find themselves in, and the collision happens without the electrons ending up frothing around.
