There's a kind of feeble-mindedness which results from spending too much time arguing with annoying people who are wrong about something in a way that makes it easy to beat them in arguments.

For example, once you learn a tiny bit about economics and libertarianism, it's easy to notice that liberals are really bad at thinking about tradeoffs. So you get used to being right when you make arguments of the form "that regulation is stupid for one of the following three cookie-cutter reasons". And liberals usually don't have any kind of sensible response.

You say "Look, whatever, I can imagine in theory some reasons that you might end up being right about this policy point. But I'm extremely skeptical--you don't seem to understand what a cost-benefit analysis would even be, so I am not particularly inclined to believe that you'd ."
