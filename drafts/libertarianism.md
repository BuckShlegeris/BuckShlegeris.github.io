I wish I could get enthusiastic about libertarianism. I just can't.

I'm a very strong believer in economics, by which I mean that I hold radical beliefs like "when you increase the cost of a good, people will probably consume at least somewhat less of it" and "in cases of small externalities, the supply curve is equal to the MSC curve and the demand curve is equal to the MSB curve".

I hate how liberals regularly deny basic economic realities like that. I hate that in Cass Sunstein's recent piece about books to convince liberals of conservatism, Sunstein says

"Economists love to draw attention to the unintended consequences of apparently public-spirited reforms. For example, big increases in the minimum wage can increase unemployment, and expensive environmental controls imposed on new cars might actually increase environmental harm, by increasing the prices of cleaner vehicles and thus decreasing fleet turnover."

as if those two "unintended consequences" were anything other than dead obvious.

I wish that these was a political movement which understood basic economics. Libertarianism would like to claim that it is that political movement. But it really doesn't seem like it.

I think libertarians get feeble-minded


climate change.
