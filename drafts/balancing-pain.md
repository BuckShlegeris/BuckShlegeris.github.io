title: "My beliefs on the balance of pain and pleasure"

Here are some beliefs of mine about how pain and pleasure are balanced.

**Pain and pleasure are balanced by default.** That is, our initial assumption should be that sentient organisms which are optimized for a particular environment or purpose will end up feeling roughly equal pain and pleasure their under normal circumstances.

Why would this be true? One reason to believe this is the reason Yew-Kwang Ng gives in his paper ["Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of Animal Consciousness and Suffering"](http://www.stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf):  that there's a metabolic cost associated with pain and pleasure, and there are increasing marginal costs to evolution for giving stronger reward signals to organisms.

Is this just a random fluke of biological systems? Possibly. But it seems plausible to me that some nonlinearity in the costs of experiences is a necessary condition for something experiencing pleasure or pain. If "giving a reward" to an agent is just incrementing a counter somewhere, I generally suspect that that agent is not conscious.

If there's this nonlinearity in the metabolic cost of pain and pleasure, then metabolic efficiency concerns are going to push for organisms having weaker valence. There has to be some

**There are some specific reasons this balance ends up broken.**

- Pain and pleasure are balanced by default
  - for efficiency, in things which have costs to each
  - these efficiency constraints feel like necessary conditions for consciousness
- There are some things that break this balance
  - pain of death
  - unnatural environments
    - humans
    - animal agriculture
  - unsophisticated mental mechanisms
- The far future will probably have this balance broken less
  - ems might be able to modify themselves and probably won't die the same way as we do
  - AI-controlled:
    - most matter won't be computronium
    - most computronium won't be sentient
    - most sentient computronium will have a better balance
