It's a lot easier to learn things when they're fun to do. When I've been trying to learn things in the past, I've often felt like there's a threshold of skill which I need to attain. Before I make it to this threshold, I'm confused and lost most of the time, and I regularly get stuck and have no idea what the problem is or how to go about fixing it. After I've made it past that threshold of competency, things go much smoother. When things go wrong, I have some idea how to diagnose the problem and look for a solution.

Why is there this threshold effect? I can think of a few reasons.

- Explanations are often targeted at an intermediate level. Before you know enough to read the explanations aimed at intermediate people, you're only able to read the beginner explanations, which often cover a much more limited range of topics. I can usually understand a paragraph where I know 80% of the jargon, but if I only understand 30% of the jargon I'm much more likely to be so lost that I don't even know which terms I should look up.
- Before I know how all the concepts fit together, it's hard for me to express my questions in ways that search engines or Stack Overflow answerers will understand.
- When I'm using a bunch of tools and I understand most of them quite well, if I get stuck I can use what I know about the familiar tools to isolate the problem. But if I don't know how to use the tools yet, it's harder for me to be confident that I didn't mess up any particular part.

When you're trying to learn something, I think that one of your main goals should be finding a way of learning it which lets you get over this threshold as quickly as possible. For example, [Jeff Kaufman recommends](http://www.jefftk.com/p/teach-yourself-any-instrument) learning piano over flute, because it's much easier to play simple, nice tunes on piano.

Examples of this in my life:

- I got good enough at programming to have fun sometime

- things where this doesn't happen:
  - A lot of craft things
    - does happen in baking, not other cooking

This is my attempt to collate
