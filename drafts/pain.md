[this is more a sequence of notes and citations than a readable intro to the topic]

One really important question for hedonic utilitarians is whether we expect sentient beings to have overall positive or negative lives if they arise through processes that don't care about their happiness. For example, wild animals arise through evolution, which [doesn't care about their suffering](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/). In the future we might create a [paperclip maximizing superintelligence](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer) which converts all of the observable universe into paperclips; it might have [subagents who act as scientists and engineers researching paperclip manufacturing](https://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#What_about_paperclippers). And without some [singleton](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html) controlling everything, the universe might be slowly taken over by agents who [optimize for reproductive success at the expense of everything else](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).



Yew-Kwang Ng, in his paper ["Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of
Animal Consciousness and Suffering"](http://www.stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf), has some useful points about how we might expect happiness and suffering to be distributed:

> First, both enjoyment and suffering are costly in terms of energy requirement, tissue maintenance, etc. This is why we feel neutral most of the time when we are not starving, eating, having sex, etc. (It would be nice if we could be programmed to feel ecstatic most of the time.) Secondly, it is likely that the extra (or marginal) costs involved in having an extra unit of enjoyment (or suffering) increases with the amount of enjoyment (suffering). Viewed differently, we have diminishing marginal returns in both enjoyment and suffering per unit of cost. Thirdly, it is likely that the costs (generalized resource costs, not subjective welfare costs) of suffering are unlikely to be significantly less, and maybe actually more, than those of enjoyment.

Ng then presents a proof of the following proposition:

> Proposition 3 (Buddhist Premise): Under the assumptions of concave and
symmetrical functions relating costs to enjoyment and suffering, evolutionary
economizing results in the excess of total suffering over total enjoyment.

His argument IS THIS...

Carl Shulman writes, in [Are pain and pleasure equally energy-efficient?](http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/03/are-pain-and-pleasure-equally-energy.html):

> So hedonistic utilitarians could approximate the net pleasure generated in our galaxy by colonization as the expected production of hedonium, multiplied by the "hedons per joule" or "hedons per computation" of hedonium (call this H), minus the expected production of dolorium, multiplied by "dolors per joule" or "dolors per computation" (call this D).

> By symmetry, my default expectation would be that H=D. Insofar as pain and pleasure involve accessibility to conscious reflection, connections to decision-making and memory, these pose like demands for both pain and pleasure. Evolutionary arguments about the distribution of pain and pleasure in the lives of animals, e.g. that in the lifecycle of some organism there are more things that it is important to avoid than to approach, are irrelevant to hedonium and dolorium. Pleasure (or pain) is set to maximum, not allocated to solve a control problem for a reproduction machine.
>
> This is important to remember since our intuitions and experience may mislead us about the intensity of pain and pleasure which are possible. In humans, the pleasure of orgasm may be less than the pain of deadly injury, since death is a much larger loss of reproductive success than a single sex act is a gain. But there is nothing problematic about the idea of much more intense pleasures, such that their combination with great pains would be satisfying on balance.

Subroutines probably get averaged more, so they don't feel things as lopsidedly.
