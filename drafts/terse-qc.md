title:  "My terse notes on the quantum mechanics of electrons"

About a year ago, I suddenly experienced an overpowering urge to learn the physics that leads to chemistry. After a few months, I felt pretty good about my understanding.

Here is the set of notes that I wish had been available for me.

## Intro: goals and nongoals

The goal of this post is to provide some types and equations such that if you had an exponentially powerful computer (or just a quantum computer), you'd be able to answer a large set of questions about chemistry and materials science.

Here are some of those questions:

- What is the bond length in a hydrogen molecule?


Here are some questions that you won't be able to answer, and why:

- What is the heat capacity of iron?
  - This requires the quantum mechanics of nuclei, rather than electrons.


- Electrons
