What are the biggest externalities of human life, both positive and negative? I'm interested in answers for both Americans and non-Americans.

The biggest short-term negative externality is probably the effect on animals, obviously. The average American consumes enough flesh and eggs to be the equivalent of having about two chickens and two fish suffering at all times, as well as 30%ish of another animal (from [Peter Hurford's numbers](http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet/)). This is probably a way bigger effect than anything else we're going to think of.

CO2 emissions are another obvious negative externality. The US emitted [16.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita](http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2014) in 2014. Katja Grace quoted a figure of [1600 tonnes CO2 per DALY](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2013/11/less-burn-for-your-buck-part-ii/). So the average American is doing 1% of a DALY damage from CO2 emissions every year.

Two types of positive externalities might be an increased population to share fixed costs over, and faster innovation. For example, maybe the US wouldn't need a larger military if its population were 20% larger, so this expansion of population would decrease the fixed cost of our giant army. Similarly, maybe some types of ideas are spread very widely very quickly, so having more people makes everyone better off. But I don't have a very good sense of how big this effect is.

One obvious type of negative externality is if there's some fixed resource which we all need to share. I'm not sure how big such externalities are.

What important externalities have I forgotten? Which of these matter the most? My current impression is that none of these seem very significant except for the animal consumption one.
