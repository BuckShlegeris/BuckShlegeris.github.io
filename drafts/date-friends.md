A non-rationalist friend of mine asked me whether I thought it was a good idea for them to date someone who was closely socially connected to them. Here's my response:

It depends how good you both are at dating. The main advantage is that it means both of you are more strongly incentivized to avoid doing the wrong thing, because doing the wrong thing will have more long term effects on your reputation. Eg if I’m dating some random stranger and then I cheat on her or otherwise mistreat her, maybe she and all her my friends hate me, but I don’t care because it’s really easy for me to never talk to her or her friends again. So I’m not very strongly incentivized to treat her well. And she likewise has a weaker incentive to be good to me.

(This isn't just bad because it means that we're more likely to hurt each other. It's also bad because we're both going to be more hesitant to agree to arrangements which would make both of us better off, but which also give us bigger opportunities to betray each other. Put another way, the benefit of trust isn't just a reduction of betrayal, it's an increase in positive experiences which come with a risk of betrayal.)

So that's a big advantage of dating people who are closely socially connected to you.

However, some people find that they consistently do badly at graciously exiting romantic relationships. In normal society, it seems to be normal to dislike your exes. If this is true, and you expect to dislike your exes after the relationship breaks up (which it almost certainly will), then this is a strong reason to avoid dating people who will be hard to avoid.

Incidentally, why is it normal to dislike your exes? I would have thought that publicly admitting that you dislike your ex would be like admitting that you aren't very good at discerning whether people are trustworthy or not, which I'd imagine would make you look bad. People don't normally talk so negatively about their former business partners, coworkers, housemates, or old friends who they don't see as much anymore.

I can think of a few reasons. To start with, I think humans are more irrational


I think that this is because society has kind of fucked up and inconsistent ideas about how romance should go
which makes it hard to end relationships well
If you think that affects you, then that’s a reason to want to be able to avoid the person
My social group is incredibly romantically incestuous
Like, if you draw a diagram of who’s dating whom, it’s ridiculously closely connected
Which works out alright for us, because we tend to have relatively amicable breakups
And maybe it leads to more amicable breakups.
