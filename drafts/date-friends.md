A non-rationalist friend of mine asked me whether I thought it was a good idea for them to date someone who was closely socially connected to them. Here's my response:

It depends how good you both are at dating. The main advantage is that it means both of you are more strongly incentivized to avoid doing the wrong thing, because doing the wrong thing will have more long term effects on your reputation. Eg if I’m dating some random stranger and then I cheat on her or otherwise mistreat her, maybe she and all her my friends hate me, but I don’t care because it’s really easy for me to never talk to her or her friends again. So I’m not very strongly incentivized to treat her well. And she likewise has a weaker incentive to be good to me.

(This isn't just bad because it means that we're more likely to hurt each other. It's also bad because we're both going to be more hesitant to agree to arrangements which would make both of us better off, but which also give us bigger opportunities to betray each other. Put another way, the benefit of trust isn't just a reduction of betrayal, it's an increase in positive experiences which come with a risk of betrayal.)

So that's a big advantage of dating people who are closely socially connected to you.

However, some people find that they consistently do badly at graciously exiting romantic relationships. In normal society, it seems to be normal to dislike your exes. If this is true, and you expect to dislike your exes after the relationship breaks up (which it almost certainly will), then this is a strong reason to avoid dating people who will be hard to avoid.

Incidentally, why is it normal to dislike your exes? I would have thought that publicly admitting that you dislike your ex would be like admitting that you aren't very good at discerning whether people are trustworthy or not, which I'd imagine would make you look bad. People don't normally talk so negatively about their former business partners, coworkers, housemates, or old friends who they don't see as much anymore.

I think one explanation for this is that society has kind of conflicting ideas about what romance is and what it's for. To some extent, romance is for casual sex, and to some extent, it's for establishing relationships that can last thirty years. This is always going to be a source of tension.

Another reason that I think people often think badly of their exes is that anger cauterizes emotional wounds. It can hurt to be rejected or to reject someone; this plausibly hurts less when you think of the person as a newly revealed asshole.

People thinking badly of their exes is also going to be a self-fufilling prophecy. If you know that your ex probably won't speak well of you anyway, there's no reason not to be an asshole to them as you're breaking up.

So if it seems likely that the relationship will end badly, you might want to consider not dating people you're socially connected to.

One way of looking at this would be to look at your past romantic relationships. If you have mostly cordial relationships with your exes, dating people who you're socially connected to looks like a better idea.
