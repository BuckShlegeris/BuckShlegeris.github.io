# inclusiveness in EA

Here is my collection of thoughts on how EA should think about what people it wants to have associated with it.

## What are the advantages of having people involved in EA?

- Obviously, they might do more good than they otherwise would have done. Eg they might provide money to EA causes, or they might do direct work.
- I think that some proportion of people are "latent EAs"
