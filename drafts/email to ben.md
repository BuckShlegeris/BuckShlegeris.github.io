Hey Ben

Here’s something I’ve been thinking about recently—I’d love to get your thoughts on it.

EAs often try to get software engineering jobs without considering the relative usefulness of the skills they’ll learn in different jobs. I think that this is a mistake, because some jobs give you much more useful experience than others. In particular, I think EAs should prefer working in product-focused full stack web development to working on small parts of mid-tier web services at large companies.

Earning to give as a software engineer isn’t a particularly great strategy. Here are some plausible things that I might want to do after working as a software engineer:

1. Try to earn to give regardless, eg founding companies
2. Found directly valuable startups
3. Work as a software engineer doing something directly valuable
4. Work as a non-software-engineer doing something directly valuable
5. Work on AI safety
6. Work on AI as a researcher, try to influence values

For those first three options, full stack development is clearly a more valuable skill.

I worked for most of last year at PayPal. I've worked at Triplebyte for about eight months.

What I've been learning at Triplebyte has been much more useful than what I learned at PayPal.
