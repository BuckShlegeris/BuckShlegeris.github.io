**I presented a workshop at EA Global a few weeks ago about career planning for EA software engineers. People were pretty surprised by its content and seemed to think it was useful, so I've adapted it to writing.**

I'm aiming this talk at people who are already engineers. I give a bunch of advice here which I don't think is overall good advice for people who plan to become software engineers but haven't been hired yet. I wrote some advice [here](/2016/08/14/bootcamp-attendees.html) for people who plan to attend bootcamps.

80000 Hours is general advice on good paths. I'm going to talk about specific career destinations and how to get there, because that makes it clearer what you should do.

## Key questions

### Where should you be heading?

- Earn to give by founding companies
- Direct work by founding a company
- Direct work as a software engineer at someone else’s organization
- Direct work as a non-software-engineer, eg working as a researcher for 80000 Hours
- Try to work on AI safety

### What do you need to learn about yourself?

What questions about yourself are relevant to deciding between career pathways?

- How well do you work when you’re self-directed?
- Different jobs require different skills
  - Distributed systems programming
  - Management
  - Product management


What uncertainties about the future and EA are there?

- How useful is money? How useful will it be in 5 or 10 years?
- Which cause areas are going to have the best direct work opportunities in the future?
- Which things are major funders going to saturate?

How confident are your answers?

Not very. Conclusion: diversify! You want to aim to learn skills that are valuable under many different ways the world could go.
