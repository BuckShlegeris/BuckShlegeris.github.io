[content warning: futurism.]

I think it's pretty plausible that humanity will accidentally wipe itself out by creating a superintelligent AI that optimizes the universe for some goal that is totally morally neutral to me--the canonical example being a paperclip maximizer whose goal is maximizing the number of paperclips in the universe. If you haven't heard of any of this before, [go read the Wait But Why post explaining it](waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html).

One obvious question is whether the paperclip-maximizing AI would overall suffer or feel pleasure, and how much pleasure or suffering it would end up feeling.

## Previous opinions

Brian Tomasik [writes](https://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#What_about_paperclippers):

But what if, as seems mildly likely, Earth is taken over by a paperclip maximizer, i.e., an unconstrained automation or optimization process? Wouldn't that reduce suffering because it would eliminate wild ETs as the paperclipper spread throughout the galaxy, without causing any additional suffering?

It will want to do science, perform lab experiments on sentient creatures, possibly run suffering subroutines, and so forth. It will require lots of intelligent and potentially sentient robots to coordinate and maintain its paperclip factories, energy harvesters, and mining operations, as well as scientists and engineers to design them. And the paperclipping scenario would entail similar black swans as a human-inspired AI. Paperclippers would presumably be less intrinsically humane than a "friendly AI," so some might cause significantly more suffering than a friendly AI, though others might cause less, especially the "minimizing" paperclippers, e.g., cancer minimizers or death minimizers.

> 3. Even considering these, we may find it plausible that happiness could dominate suffering. For example, most humans have net positive lives, even though they’re capable of greater suffering than happiness, simply because they spend more time (mildly) happy than they spend suffering. This might hold true for paperclip maximizers, as well.

Perhaps a paperclip maximizer brain experiences between -0.01 and -1 QALYs per watt-year. Then to calculate the expected utility of the paperclip maximizer scenario, we’ll use the same numbers as the previous section but change the number of brains per watt to 10<sup>-1</sup>. Then parameters (median, σ<sup>2</sup>) for the number of suffering life years in the paperclip condition are (6x10<sup>44</sup>, 5.0).

## My opinion

I think that paperclip maximizers would plausibly create a universe with lots conscious experience relative to their energy consumption. However, I think that their conscious experience has an expected value near zero.

I think there are a few different broad categories of activities that paperclippers might spend the universe's energy on:

- Working on their their terminal goal (eg, making paperclips). This involves direct effort, which I'll call "manufacturing", and it involves thinking about ways to execute their goal more efficiently, which is science or engineering work.
- Defence--they might spend effort on defending themselves against others with competing goals. Again, some of this is engineering and some is manufacturing.

### How much energy will go into thinking vs manufacturing?
