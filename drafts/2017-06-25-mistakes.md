Iâ€™ve conducted about three hundred programming interviews. I often see programmers trip themselves up with bad decisions about the small-scale organization of their code. At least some of these mistakes are simple enough that I think I can explain them to people who make them.

As a running example, I'm going to be talking about implementing a console version of Connect 4, because Triplebyte used to use this as a programming project and so I've seen a lot of people try it.

## 1. Prefer early returns to setting return values

Suppose you want to check whether a list has any odd numbers in it. I claim that this:

python
```
def has_any_odd(some_list):
    for x in some_list:
        if x % 2 == 1:
            return True

    return False
```

is better than this:

python
```
def has_any_odd(some_list):
    flag = False

    for x in some_list:
        if x % 2 == 1:
            flag = True

    return flag
```
