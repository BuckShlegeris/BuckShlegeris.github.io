There are a lot of EAs who work as programmers, because it's a good fit for their interests and it's an easy way to make a reasonably good salary. But I don't think that many of them should be confident that they will want to work as programmers over the long term. I think that these programmers will be well served by thinking now about things they might want to do in the future, and thinking about what they can do now to have more options later.
