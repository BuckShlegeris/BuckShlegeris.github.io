# morality of economists

I enjoy seeing economists try to talk about morality. I think of it as kind of a perverted mirror image of utilitarianism.

Like utilitarians, economists have a clear quantifiable definition of moral value, which is built by extrapolating from a few simple moral intuitions to a generalized theory. Their generalized theory ends up proposing some pretty counterintuitive things. It’s interesting to see how economists interact with their moral theory when it starts proposing strange things. I'm going to call it "economist morality".

Who do I mean by “economists” here? I’m describing the moral beliefs implied in [Modern Principles of Economics](https://smile.amazon.com/Modern-Principles-Economics-Tyler-Cowen/dp/1429278390/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472884030&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=modern+principles+of+eceonomics) by Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok, particularly in the chapter on “Economics, Ethics, and Public Policy”; The Armchair Economist by Steven Landsburg (you can read a relevant excerpt from the latter [here](http://shlegeris.com/2016/08/24/armchair.html); and [this short EconLib article](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/EthicsandEconomics.html). These three sources match my general impression of how economists talk.

Economists don't often directly say that they're confident in their moral beliefs. But they often strongly advocate particular policies for moral reasons which are clearly derived from economist morality.
