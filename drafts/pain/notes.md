## Notes to myself

subtopics:

- [Enumerating the reasons for pain and pleasure](./different-types-of-rewards)
  > In this post I list many different evolutionary purposes that suffering and pleasure serve, and also list situations in which creatures will feel suffering or pleasure as in incidental effect of how evolution plays out.

things I should look into:

- Check out the learning psychology literature on the difference in effectiveness between positive reward and positive punishment

to write:

- different types of pleasure, purposes of those
- discuss those different strengthening incentives in more detail.
- discuss conditions under which lives are net positive and net negative.
- discuss what causes total happiness or suffering to increase.
- implications for welfare of real species (eg social animals vs non-social animals, maybe the social animals fear death less).
- Simulations for RL agents.
- investigation of how this ties in with properties of different Markov decision processes.
