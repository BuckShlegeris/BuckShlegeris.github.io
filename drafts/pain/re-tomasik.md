[Brian's article](http://reducing-suffering.org/why-organisms-feel-both-suffering-and-happiness/) is pretty good. Here are some thoughts I have on it.

> Some things animals are supposed to avoid (fire, predators, bodily injury, etc.), and some things they're supposed to seek out (food, shelter, mates, etc.).

This distinction is true of animals but it isn't true of agents in general. It feels pretty natural to talk about neutral actions for animals, eg standing around doing nothing, which you can naturally use as a zero point. But if you look at a n-armed bandit problem or something, there isn't a natural zero point, and rewards are unbounded in both directions. There are also prediction problems, which have a natural formulation where the best possible reward is zero and you try to get as close to zero as possible.

> When you get hungry, you don't just have a lack of pleasure, but you have an active discomfort. This is sort of like "make everything painful except eating." The same can be true for other pleasures, including addictions: Sometimes it's not that the drug makes you feel good -- it's that doing anything other than taking the drug makes you feel bad.

I think this might be related to the theory that suffering and pleasure can be related to the strength of motivation or alertness. Maybe you feel this chronic pain from hunger partially because you need to be motivated to work on finding food.
