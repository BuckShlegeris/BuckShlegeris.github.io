# Software engineering careers for EAs

Advice for software engineers:

Don’t earn to give. Don’t do things which let you earn to give long term.

Things to optimize:

- Potential for entrepreneurship.
- Potential for direct work.
- Knowing something useful about AI.
- Learning about things other than programming

Ideas:

- Take positions which are as product-focused as possible.
- Full stack ftw
- Minimize bureaucracy
- Small companies
- machine learning
- If you're going to drop out of engineering, get prestige instead of skills now

Try to avoid miscellaneous positions in the middle of a web stack somewhere.

Lots of EAs work as software engineers or plan to. Now that earning to give doesn’t seem like as good an idea as it useful to, I think EA software engineers should be making their career choices slightly differently than they’ve been doing in the past. I have an unusually clear perspective on what people learn at different software engineering jobs because of my job. This is my attempt to use that experience to give advice on software engineering careers to EAs.

As an EA, it is probably a bad idea to unthinkingly crawl up the software engineering ladder indefinitely, because that’s not a very good way to EtG and EtG probably isn’t a good long term strategy.

Different areas of software engineering differ enormously in how applicable they are to the different things you might end up doing after software engineering. For example, product-focused full-stack development seems more useful for almost every career pathway than working on mid-tier web services (which is what I was doing at PayPal last year). However, I have never seen these considerations explicitly discussed in EA advice for software engineers. Many more EAs would be qualified to work at Wave, Arbital, or 80K if they had been working in full stack development instead of whatever Google is paying them to do.

There seems to be a tradeoff between prestige/salary and usefulness. For example, I think small companies give you better learning opportunities, but they’re usually worse for prestige and salary. I discuss why this is and how to get around it.


## Earning to give is no longer a good idea

## What should engineers do?

Here are six different types of useful work that you can do.

- Try to earn to give regardless, eg founding companies
- Found directly valuable startups
- Work as a software engineer doing something directly valuable
	- Full stack
		- Wave, Arbital
	- Research engineering
- Work as a non-software-engineer doing something directly valuable
- Work on AI safety
- Work on AI as a researcher, try to influence values
	- DeepMind, Google Brain

## What skills are useful?

- Full stack development
- Quantitative reasoning
- Product design
- Machine learning

Skills that are not useful: low level systems, web backends, distributed systems, anything academic except ML and AI safety.

## How this should affect what job you take

- It makes the big companies look worse. They teach you less about FSD, QR, and PD.
- It means you should try harder to get product positions.

Ways that startup jobs go terribly wrong:

- You end up implementing godawful things as part of small systems
- You end up doing lots of non-software-engineering tasks
- Your coworkers are bad. It's harder to evaluate whether a place is good than whether a company is literally Google or not.

## Contracting

- seems plausibly like it makes you learn more things.
- lower status
- Pivotal Labs


[1] I work as an engineer at Triplebyte. I've interviewed about 200 engineers, and I've worked with many others through the job search process.


## Questions for my colleagues

- Being able to quickly develop a wide variety of software is helpful when you're starting a company or project.


## Other notes

- Looks like if you do hard technical things, you can move into MTS roles, but if you kick ass at product programming, you end up a manager
