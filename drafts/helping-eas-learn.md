Some of my wise friends think that there's a problem with EA where new people aren't learning all the stuff that EAs who've been around longer know.

Lots of EAs seem to not know much of the material in other cause areas, and not know how ignorant they are.

## solutions

**Effective altruism Boot Camp.** The idea is something like the Pareto fellowship in that it allows a structured way of letting EA's learn about EA. Days could be focused on for example different cause areas. A good curriculum for this could result in creating a bunch of EA's who have much better understanding of the main issues than most EA's do especially new EA's. I would even appreciate the opportunity to really learn about a bunch of different things and make myself feel more confident about the breath of my knowledge.

Collate resources for learning about various EA relevant topics like Gene Drive's. **Make quizlet quizzes** or manually make my own quizzes to test these concepts. This could encourage better general understanding among effective altruists.
