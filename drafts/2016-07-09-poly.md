I used to be strongly in favor of polyamory. I'm now much less enthusiastic about it. If something disastrous happened and I broke up with both of the women I'm dating, I wouldn't particularly mind dating someone monogamously.

I'm not just being a sore loser: my polyamorous relationships have only gone terribly wrong in a way that couldn't have happened in a monogamous relationship on a few occasions. I'm also more pessimistic about monogamy than I've ever been before.

Here's why.


Poly worked great when I was young and promiscuous.
