I’m not nearly as worried about astronomical future suffering as I used to be. I changed my mind on this over approximately the last year, but I haven’t written about it properly until now.

I think this is because Brian is not a hedonic utilitarian, but he's pessimistic enough to have lots of thoughts that other people didn't have, and so he did the best writing on them.

## We probably won’t spread factory farming to the stars.

## Wild animals don’t have clearly negative lives

## Suffering subroutines seem about as likely as happy subroutines
