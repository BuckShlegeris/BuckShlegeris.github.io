Are there any good educational tools?

I'm trying to think of good educational tools that aren't just good work tools
Eg there are lots of little simulations of math things around the internet
But none of them seem to be so good that they've become totally universal as the explanation of the topic they're trying to explain
I'm not sure I can think of any examples of really good educational materials that aren't just basically writing and exercises
There are good diagrams, too

flashcards?

Sort of?
But those are still extremely low tech and simple
And they're not really particular per subject
There are some good educational tools that are just useful work tools
like Mathematica

Daniel
anki isn't *that* low-tech
Shurgleburg
It's extremely general though
And it's not universally used



I am confused by how few technologically advanced educational tools there are.

The internet has lots of educational materials on it, but it’s basically just a better distribution network for lectures, diagrams, and written explanations of things.

And there are lots of tools which try to be educational.

In the context of computer science, there are some things which are basically really simple toy environments. Like codecademy.com or rPeANUt. Those are good.

Things that are valuable for real life often have more effort put into them, so it’s easy for them to be the best tools.

Sometimes things that try to be toy environments get outpaced. Eg Hugs.

Also there are things which are basically just extremely specific software so that students can not do part of a project.

One theme is extremely simple UI and limited functionality.
