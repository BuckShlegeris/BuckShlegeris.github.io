title:  "EA programmers should program less at work"
date:   ""
---

This post is aimed at software engineers. I think it probably applies somewhat to people who aren't software engineers, but I don't know as much about other jobs so it's harder for me to say. Among software engineers, I think it's much safer advice for those with at least a year's experience.

This is a follow up to [EA Programmers should plan exit strategies](TODO). In that post, I argued that programmers should think about what they might want to do in the future, and that there's a good chance they will want the option to move away from programming. I said that while they're programmers, they should take whatever opportunities they get to gain robustly useful skills and learn about their inclinations, so that they'll have more non-programming options in the future.

I think that this is important enough that EA programmers should consider these factors when deciding between jobs. But if you're already working as a programmer, there are often opportunities to take on projects at your current job that aren't strictly software engineering and might help you develop other skills.

Here's a rough framework for assessing how valuable programming experience at work is: It's more valuable if you're learning more quickly and if the thing you're learning about is more relevant to your future plans. So the longer you work as a programmer or work with a particular technology, the less valuable your marginal programming is. Because of this, my arguments are much more applicable to people who aren't at their first job. I wrote HERE TODO about how useful I think different programming skills are. You should look at that list there and customize it based on your interests and long term plans: that will affect what programming tasks seem worth your time.


## Non-programming tasks

There are lots of tasks which aren't strictly programming which often come up in software teams. Often no-one particularly wants to do them and so it's easy to get them just by taking the initiative when work is being distributed. And if you're already working as a programmer, I think that the learning value of these non-programming tasks is often higher than the learning value of spending more time writing code.

The strongest arguments for doing varied tasks is that returns diminish quickly. I spent maybe two hours earlier this year trying to negotiate with a business over the price we'd set for something we were trying to buy, and even just after that two hours I feel like I'd be much better prepared for negotiating with another business in the future. This experience would be quite hard to acquire on my own. In contrast, I spent two hours today programming in Python and didn't get much better at that at all.

Here are some examples of non-programming tasks which are often available to software engineers. Not all of these are available to everyone, obviously.

- **Interviewing.** This is a great opportunity to practice meeting new people in a professional setting where you're taking the dominant role. I have spent enough time interviewing now that my returns have diminished enormously. But it was pretty useful at the start.
- **Data analysis/analytics.** In some situations you can get really knowledgeable about the schema of your database and get really fast at answering questions about user flows and similar things in your application. Even if you work at a company with full time data scientists, you probably understand the software you work on better than they do, and you might be able to do small bits of analysis. It's easy for me at Triplebyte because we don't have any full-time data scientists and so I have lots of opportunities to do bits of statistics work. Doing some data science work has been *super* useful for me. I am much better at statistics than I was a year ago, and this improved understanding has made me feel much more qualified to think about lots of things I discuss with EAs.
- **Writing.** Many companies have blogs and are very happy to have enthusiastic employees write for them occasionally.
- **User support.** I have gotten better at email from manning the Triplebyte user support email for a while, and I'm glad I did it. It is unlikely that you'll have to fight too hard to own the user support. If you're at a big company, then you might have an opportunity to be the interface for other teams who want to integrate with the software your team produces. This interaction might be useful.
- **Miscellaneous practical web tasks:** web design, sysadmin, etc. Knowing how to deploy a simple server to the internet with a nice website on it is one of the most robustly useful programming-related skills.

## Downsides of this strategy

What are the downsides of trying to do non-programming tasks?

The clearest is that if you spend less time programming, you won't get better at programming as quickly. This could have bad effects like causing your income to rise less quickly, by causing you to miss opportunities for promotions or if it stymies your ability to pass programming interviews and move up the salary ladder that way.

My main response to that is that programming skill isn't that enormously relevant for the most common way software engineers increase their wages over time, which is to occasionally shift job and get an according raise. This just involves passing programming interviews and sounding experienced. Once you've been working for a year, your work is probably an order of magnitude less efficient at making you better at programming interviews than interview practice and reading articles on Hacker News. (A corrolary of this is that EA programmers might find it worthwhile to spend more time practicing interviewing while they're working. TODO: WRITE ABOUT THIS)  As I said above, this is not true for junior developers.

Another downside of being worse at programming is that programming skill might be helpful in a later job, like founding a startup or doing some kinds of direct work. This is true, especially if you're doing a job which is particularly good at teaching you skills that are directly relevant to things you're quite likely to want to do in the future. But at a lot of jobs, you're not actually getting better at the things which are most relevant to projects you'll want to do in the future anyway. See my "What programmer skills are most useful for things" post. TODO

Another risk of a lot of the non-programming work I suggested, especially the jobs like user support and interviewing which other people probably don't want, is that you might get stuck doing them forever. Many of the above things are valuable experiences for the first ten hours but not the next 100. It's easy to get stuck doing them, especially if you end up being the one person on the team who knows about topic X and there's never quite enough spare cycles to train someone else up. This risk is worth considering, but it's irrelevant to many situations.

Another problem is that at some jobs, your performance reviews are tied to your technical performance. That makes this strategy worse than it would otherwise be. You might be able to find some kind of leeway with your manager, or you might decide that the other experience is worth the performance review hit. Maybe it's worth talking to your manager or otherwise looking into the metrics that will be used in your performance reviews, to see how important this is. (My guess is that for most teams, you'll end up being more useful to them because of this strategy, because it will cause you to take the initiative on tasks other people might not have wanted.)

The kind of non-programming opportunities you get vary a lot between different companies, and I think this should be an important factor in deciding between job opportunities. I plan to write more about job selection in a future post.
