The Gini coefficient is the most common statistic used to describe income inequality. I made a tool for visualizing the Gini coefficient of populations; [check it out](http://shlegeris.com/gini) if you want to quickly improve your intuitions about it.

The Gini coefficient doesn't recognize this. Here's the Lorenz curve for the incomes [1.5, 1.5, 3, 4]:

And here's the Lorenz curve for the incomes [1, 2, 3.5, 3.5]:
