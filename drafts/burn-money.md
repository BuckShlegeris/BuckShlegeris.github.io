If you want to increase the wealth of Malawians, one very simple intervention is to buy a bunch of Malawian currency and set it on fire.

Despite its extreme simplicity, I've never heard anyone propose this intervention before. Overall this intervention is probably less efficient than GiveDirectly. But it also has a number of advantages over GiveDirectly which are worth exploring--it has almost zero overhead, it doesn't require you to trust an organization, and it has less problematic effects on local inequality.

I think the more interesting property of this intervention is that it works in a lot of situations where GiveDirectly doesn't. GiveDirectly wouldn't work nearly as well without M-Pesa. It's essentially a coincidence that M-Pesa exists so early in a country with so much extreme poverty. GiveDirectly [says](https://www.givedirectly.org/faq) this is why they started out in Kenya. If I were trying to give to global poverty thirty years ago, I think that this intervention would be a lot more competitive.

## Why is burning cash helpful?

To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_burning#Macroeconomic_effect):

<blockquote>
  <p>For the purposes of <a href="/wiki/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">macroeconomics</a>, burning money is equivalent to removing the money from circulation, and locking it away forever; the salient feature is that no one may ever use the money again. Burning money shrinks the <a href="/wiki/Money_supply" title="Money supply">money supply</a>, and is therefore a special case of <a href="/wiki/Contractionary_monetary_policy" class="mw-redirect" title="Contractionary monetary policy">contractionary monetary policy</a> that can be implemented by anyone. In the usual case, the <a href="/wiki/Central_bank" title="Central bank">central bank</a> withdraws money from circulation by selling government bonds or foreign currency. The difference with money burning is that the central bank does not have to exchange any assets of value for the money burnt. Money burning is thus equivalent to gifting the money back to the central bank (or other money issuing authority). If the economy is at <a href="/wiki/Full_employment" title="Full employment">full employment</a> equilibrium, shrinking the money supply causes <a href="/wiki/Deflation" title="Deflation">deflation</a> (or decreases the rate of <a href="/wiki/Inflation" title="Inflation">inflation</a>), increasing the real value of the money left in circulation.</p>

  <p>Assuming that the burned money is <a href="/wiki/Paper_money" class="mw-redirect" title="Paper money">paper money</a> with negligible intrinsic value, no real <a href="/wiki/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a> are destroyed, so the overall wealth of the world is unaffected. Instead, all surviving money slightly increases in value; everyone gains wealth in proportion to the amount of money they already hold.<sup id="cite_ref-Landsburg_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Landsburg-2">[2]</a></sup> Economist <a href="/wiki/Steven_Landsburg" title="Steven Landsburg">Steven Landsburg</a> proposes in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Armchair_Economist" title="The Armchair Economist">The Armchair Economist</a></i> that burning one's fortune (in paper money) is a form of <a href="/wiki/Philanthropy" title="Philanthropy">philanthropy</a> more <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> than deeding it to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Treasury" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Treasury">United States Treasury</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Landsburg_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Landsburg-2">[2]</a></sup> In 1920, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nixon_Carver" title="Thomas Nixon Carver">Thomas Nixon Carver</a> wrote that dumping money into the sea is better for society than spending it wastefully, as the latter wastes the <a href="/wiki/Labour_economics" title="Labour economics">labor</a> that it hires.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

Gini wealth inequality in Malawi is 0.564. https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/rr-inequality-in-malawi-261115-en.pdf

0.736 according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth

Does this reduce competitiveness of exports? (Does GiveDirectly?)

It's [legal to burn kwatchas](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/333).
