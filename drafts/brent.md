It's been about a month since some accusations against Brent came up

- I use past tense throughout, because I'm writing about Brent's behavior during the time that he was strongly involved in the Bay Area rationalist community.
- I've tried to be fair to Brent's beliefs throughout.

I've updated strongly against the rationalist community as it actually exists, moderately against the rationalist community virtues, and mildly against the idea of rationalism.

Rationalism basically makes the claim that the rest of the world is insane, and we can do better by actually thinking about things and doing things the way that we think they should be done. This situation seems like a study in ways that this can go wrong.

Normal communities would think that it's really creepy and weird that Brent, a 40-ish-year-old man, was obviously trying to convince young women to engage in BDSM relationships with him. In the rationalist community, we think that we can do better than just naively condemning things that seem creepy. The rationalist vision is that as a community, we can put structures in place such that bad things don't happen even when individuals are pursuing relationships far outside the norm. What actually happened here is that the people around this situation (including me) didn't feel comfortable talking about how they were creeped out by the situation, and so they didn't, and so we totally failed to protect vulnerable members of our community.

The bigger failure in this situation wasn't our failure to prevent it, it was our failure to appropriately handle it. ACDC was a shitshow TODO. This falls into a similar pattern: normal communities would appoint someone who at least understands normal tropes of this kind of situation, rather than trying to do a much more difficult manuever of trying to facilitate some kind of peacemaking between the people. TODO check this.

The biggest unforced error in this whole situation was the ACDC email--TODO Describe. Again, this would be obviously terrible to most normal people.


Overall this feels like someone who sucks at a task going straight for the hardest difficulty level, and failing catastrophically, and not realizing how out of their depth they were.


Counterargument to consider: normal communities actually suck at this stuff.

To add: Duncan and Eliezer's comments on this were another interesting mistake. I think that they should have emphasized the extent to which this was a terrible fuckup on their part. Duncan was (is?) a friend of Brent's; he deserves a share of the blame. I recently discovered I was wrong about some claim about the far future--I've previously endorsed the aestivation hypothesis, which I recently was convinced is confused--and I think I felt worse about this, and tried harder to atone for misleading others, than most rationalists felt about endorsing Brent. Also, this made it seem like the rationalist leaders secretly were in favor of Brent, which I'm pretty sure is false, but it seems absurdly stupid of them to not realize that they'd be perceived that way.


I think rationalist community is a weaker community than I'd imagined. Eg a lack of community fund for this. I didn't organize this myself because it sounded like a massive pain in the ass and I assumed someone else would do it, and because I'm busy, and because I felt like responsibility for this fell on the wooey rationalists who enabled this kind of thing. Apparently I was wrong to think that they'd handle it.

## Lessons learned

Why was it possible for this to go so wrong? And what can we do about it?

### High status rationalists misplacing trust

I think that many high status rationalists, eg Anna Salamon and Nate Soares, wouldn't have fucked up as much as ACDC fucked up (though they also failed to act on queasy feelings about Brent). I think I also would have done a better job in ACDC's situation. We failed by trusting CFAR to have good judgement about how ACDC should be put together. My judgement was also wrong here--I was very surprised by how badly ACDC handled this. I think a lot of the best rationalist thinkers have stopped trying to engage with the community that heavily, and they've ended up lending their reputations to groups like CFAR that in my opinion don't deserve them.

### Lax rationalist epistemic standards

#### What I mean by low epistemic standards

Rationalism has too high a tolerance for fact-disconnected woo. For example 1, 2, 3 TODO. I think that woo is somewhat valuable; I think internal double crux, IFS therapy, focusing, and circling are all useful to me. But I think rationalism has swung too far towards unquestionably accepting mysticism, without fully appreciating the costs. I had this opinion before the Brent stuff came out.

#### This lead to Brent being harder for me to argue against

The reason I now believe it more strongly is that low epistemic standards in the rationalist community strongly discouraged me from criticising Brent as much as I wanted to.

Brent wrote Facebook comments describing his view of the world which were often absurdly myopic and sometimes just trivially false in boring ways. His main position is that social rules that are explicitly aimed at preventing certain kinds of behavior are in practice used to enforce existing power dynamics. For example, he'd argue that TODO

I thought his writing was a useful lens to have available, but he looked at everything through it to an extent that led him to really weird beliefs.

I wanted to criticise Brent's writing for being dumb, but I mostly held off because I imagined getting into really dumb arguments with him and other rationalists.

I think that if rationalism had lower tolerance for absurdly hedgehoggy people with terrible calibration, we wouldn't have had as much of a problem here.

TODO: isn't this a massive overreaction? Why would we expect that this problem predictably leads to Brent-type people? Mostly because I think it meant that people went more all-in than would be optimal?


#### How/why did this happen?

I don't know why rationalism got so much wooier recently. TODO: did it? Why?

My problem isn't with woo per se, it's with an attitude to the world that's too narrow to use the woo effectively.

Woo is dangerously absorbing, if you don't keep track of the metaphors.

Also you train yourself to have a taste for certain flavors of thinking, which leads you to relate to the outside world in a more insular way???

I think Val is to blame for some of this. He teaches classes at CFAR with a really wooey manner, that I think is bad for the culture of CFAR. At the CFAR workshop I attended early this year, I don't think I massively disagreed with Val's content, but I think his presentation style sets a bad precedent.

I think we should try to explain ourselves clearly when we can.

However, it's unreasonable to expect people to always explain themselves correctly. TODO: how to handle that?


We have a lot of damaged and weak people who make it harder to

#### What should we do?

- Be less wooey. Play the [Monday/Tuesday game](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific#yjZN9D2bHFbj2ahJJ).
- Be more foxish.
- Move towards normalcy in some ways. ???
- Be more connected to the normal world. Try harder to say our things in ways that would make sense to smart outsiders. For example, I think I have pretty good success explaining IFS therapy to smart, open-minded people. If we demand that we say things in normal ways more often, we're losing our ability to go off into weird excellent tangents, but also cutting the risk of spiraling away from reality; I think this is currently a good direction to push.
- Constant vigilance against bullshit and manipulatability.

I think Robert Wiblin's [description of rationality](https://www.facebook.com/robert.wiblin/posts/836954416525) is something like what we should be aspiring towards:

> Rationality to me is:
>
> i) Methodically collecting lots of pieces of evidence on questions you care about.
>
> ii) Learning through experience and the study of epistemology / philosophy of science which kinds of evidence are most reliable in different domains.
>
> iii) Weighing all of these pieces of evidence carefully against one another.
>
> iv) Collecting lots of other information about the world through a diverse range of experiences, travelling, talking to people you otherwise wouldn't talk to, reading books on a wide range of topics/fields, and so on.
>
> v) Using that broad range of knowledge to inform your common sense and prior probabilities, and then giving them their significant due.
>
> vi) Figuring out how to weigh your own impression of things against the opinions of people who disagree. Taking expert judgement seriously (though not so seriously you can't do anything innovative).
>
> vii) Laying out what you think and why as clearly and plainly as you possibly can, and insisting that others do likewise.
>
> viii) Keeping your brain working well through regular exercise, attention to your mental health, and so on. Working through personal problems or ideological commitments that could cloud your judgement.
>
> ix) Being fast to accept when you've been wrong (morally or factually) and keeping track of those times to stay calibrated on how right you can reasonably hope to be in future.
>
> x) Having plenty of smart friends - including some who don't share all of your deep worldview judgements, and some who are very different from you - to discuss your ideas with, get feedback and stay grounded in the real world.
>
> xi) Caring about the effect the things you say and do have on others, and accepting the many aspects of society you cannot change and will just need to work around.
>
> Basically, rationality is a slog of responsibility and hard work.
>
> I can't claim to live up to these ideals all the time by any means of course.

It's worth noting that Kelsey's part of the community handled this well.






---------

- Goals:
  - Express that I thought that this was really fucked up.
    - Show that we don't think Brent's behavior was okay.
    - Demonstrate that I don't think the ACDC response was reasonable.
    - Demonstrate that I understand ways that the rationalist community fucked up, so that we don't do them in future?


Content:

- Brent stuff happened. It looks like we fucked up a lot. I feel like this situation was a really big fuckup and hasn't so far been properly addressed.
  - In particular, I think this strikes at the core of the rationalist community's claim to be special.
- What went wrong, and why I think it is scary.
  - The rationalist community claims to be able to outperform normal communities by thinking about things. This situation feels like a cascade of examples of this going wrong in exactly the way you'd imagine.
  - Brent was creepy in ways that are externally obvious. For example, he was a 40-year-old who had a really strong desire to have BDSM-y relationships with twenty-year-old women and who had a really dark, pessimistic view of the world.
    - Rationalists don't like judging people this way, but in situations where the outside world was right, it's interesting to ask what exactly we were disagreeing with the outside world about. In this situation it doesn't look good. Normal groups would have prevented this particular thing from going wrong by disapproving of it strongly. We thought we could do better, and so we did it our own way, assuming that it would be fine, and it was terrible.
      - Plausible reasons this could have been fine:
        - Brent throws good parties and seems to have some part of a good soul.
        - The people involved are rationalists and will be able to take care of themselves.
        - The people involved are living in a group house with trusted members of the community, those people will take care of them.
        - Brent seems scrupulous.
  - ACDC handled this terribly and weirdly. This could have been solved by either not trying to have a community thing that we trusted, or by having it staffed by people who are more concerned by conflicts of interest.
    - What would have happened in a normal place?
    - Also the email.
  - Afterwards, rationalists handled it badly.
    - Eg Duncan, Eliezer.
      - I think that they should have said "I endorsed this person, I was friends with this person; to whatever extent I accidentally lent them social status, I'm sorry."
    - Including me.
    - High status rationalists didn't seem to understand how bad this shit is.
- What have we learned? What was the problem?
  - Rationalists were massively overconfident about their own abilities.
    - High status rationalists placed trust in people it was foolish to trust--this is an example of overconfidence in ability to ascertain who's trustworthy.
    - CFAR also didn't have people around to sort this shit out.
  - Rationalism has lax epistemic standards. This makes it harder to expel cult leaders and harder to notice problems where we're doing things that seem obviously crazy.
    - To combat this, try to speak clearly.
  - things to suggest:
    - if you aren't good at something, make a friend who's good at it
      - We should more often be interested in making friends with smart normal people, making predictions, seeing whose are better, and then only ignoring their judgement if we actually outpredict them.
  - Hodgepodge of small ideas:
    - Generalizing mental prowess too much.
