title:  "Are donations to the Fed better or worse than burning your cash?"

Here's a quote from The Armchair Economist:

> Every now and then, some eccentric altruist gathers up his assets and donates them to the United States Treasury. As a result, our current or future tax bills must fall.* The beneficiaries are the many millions of U.S. taxpayers, each of whom experiences a tiny reduction in his tax burden. But we do not all benefit equally. Those of us in the highest tax brackets—by and large, the richest Americans—collect disproportionate shares of the gift.
>
> An alternative strategy for the altruist would be to convert his assets to cash and, instead of giving them to the Treasury, hold a bonfire. The result is essentially the same. Tiny benefits accrue to millions of Americans (this time in the form of falling prices rather than falling tax bills), and the total of all those benefits is equal to the altruist’s sacrifice. In the bonfire scenario, your share of the benefits is proportional not to your tax bill but to the quantity of cash you happen to be holding at the moment of the bonfire. This still tends to favor the rich, but probably less dramatically. So if you are thinking of remembering the Treasury in your will, and if you are something of an egalitarian, consider a bonfire instead.*

Those two asterisks point to the following footnotes:

> \* The most plausible scenario is that the Treasury reduces its current borrowing, so that its future obligations and the future tax burden are reduced. Under any scenario, unless the gift causes the government to revise its spending plans, a gift to the Treasury must lower taxes one way or another.
>
> \* It might be worth noting, however, that when you make a gift to money holders, the biggest winners of all are likely to come from that class of people who frequently travel with suitcases containing several million dollars.

So the author thinks that cash bonfires are a more egalitarian cash transfer than Fed donations. I am interested in checking this claim. Here are some questions I want to answer:

- There's a lot of wealth inequality, so transferring money to people proportionally to their wealth is going to be a pretty unequal distribution too. Is this more or less unequal than the tax base?
- How much does increasing government cash reserves affect government spending? Government spending is often targeted towards people with lower incomes.
- Deflation harms people in debt. How is debt distributed among the population?

## How unequally distributed is the tax burden compared to wealth?

I'm going to define this question as "where does the median "

Here's a table of the tax burden in different quintiles of income:
