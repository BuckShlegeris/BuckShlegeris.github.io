lots of companies ask algorithms questions, here is why

- g loaded
- good excuse for hard programming logic

companies ask this even if they aren't big or algorithmy

## Canonical algorithms

- List structures: arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists
- Set and map structures: hash maps, binary search trees, heaps
- Graph algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's
- Sorting, searching


Skiena is my favorite textbook for this.

notes

- Dijkstra thing

## Canonical interview material

- Dynamic programming
- Recursion
- Iterating around and over the famous data structures
- Composing fast data structures for a problem



CtCI is great for this.

## Hard stuff

Then there's actually hard material that some companies ask. For example,

- Convex hull
- Details of balanced binary search trees

- Particularly interesting data structures:
  - 2-3-4 tree isomorphism, BTrees
  - Augmented BSTs
  - Union find
  - RMQ
