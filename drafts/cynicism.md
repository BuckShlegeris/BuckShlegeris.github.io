Sometimes people signal cynicism and sometimes they signal naivety. I think this is somewhat interesting.

Normally you don’t get social praise for saying that you’re ignorant and confused by things. But in some situations you do.

Sometimes people say “I don’t understand why some men catcall women. Do they really think that the woman is going to say ‘why yes, I am interested in sleeping with you.’?” Saying this seems to be socially praised, even though confusion and ignorance aren’t normally praiseworthy. This sentence is an exception because it’s a way of saying that you’re so not interested in harassing women that you don’t understand why would someone would want to. This is an example of social praise for displaying naivety. (Or maybe the people are legitimately not trying to ascribe reasonableness to catcalls, maybe they’re just saying “oh those outgroup people, they’re so silly”.)

Sometimes people say “EtGers are all going to give up”. It seems like if you say that there’s an obvious hypothesis, which is that you don’t have a very strong sense of morality and you aren’t very good at following through with things that you think are morally important. That sounds like an unattractive property so it’s slightly surprising that everyone is interested in advertising this quality of themselves. I guess it overall gets socially praised because many people believe it’s common knowledge among reasonable people that no-one can last very long doing that kind of altruistic thing. So this is a way of showing off your understanding of human nature. This is an example of social praise for displaying cynicism.

It’s somewhat socially praised to say “I don’t understand what’s attractive about taking heroin.” I think liberals, who seem to think that artificial pleasure isn’t automatically bad, would disapprove of this statement because it would make the person seem ignorant. And conservatives, who are probably more morally opposed to heroin, would be more positively inclined towards someone who said this.

Sometimes conservatives say things about how it's silly to tell women that they can wear arbitrarily revealing clothes, which seems like the conservatives admitting "I am somewhat interested in raping women when I see them wearing revealing clothes”, which is an interesting thing to admit. (Daniel says “Conservatives could just be saying that they're pretty sure that certain outgroups have this quality e.g. the poor, immigrants, muslims.”) (Kelsey says “saying unacceptable stuff can be a bonding thing. 'I have made myself socially vulnerable to you, this strengthens our relationship’”) (Kelsey says “'I can't control my self around hot slutty women' is a masculinity thing, I think”; I disagree. I don’t think women find that attractive.)


Related: You get social points for saying things that seem true and interesting. This is useful, because it means that when someone realizes something true and interesting, the insight gets spread around a social group by people who are selfishly interested in getting social points.

Cynical opinions are those that https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/why-do-aphorisms-and-cynicism-go-together/

This is obviously stupid (is it? Do people think that they are going to successfully get girls by catcalling? Maybe people think they’ll get better at hitting on women by catcalling. More plausibly, it makes them feel powerful to throw their weight around. Maybe the benefit of this kind of thing is making it common knowledge that most women don’t like getting catcalled, which makes it easier to socially enforce not catcalling.)
