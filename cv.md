This page is a detailed list of many of the things I've done.

## Australian National University, Bachelor of Science

### Semester 1, 2012

#### MATH1115, intro honours math

This was the proof-based intro math course. I got a 76.

#### ENGN1211, "Discovering Engineering"

This course still makes me angry.

## Non-university
