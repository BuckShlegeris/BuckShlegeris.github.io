# HtmlWell

This is an addon to Google Docs which lets you export sections to HTML.

You can download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/htmlwell/jafchhlcnmkngcbkpblemfookamgbnoe?authuser=0).

I claimed to have documentation on this page, but that's only because Google Docs demanded that I point them to a webpage somewhere.

Please email any bugs or questions or feature requests to <a href="mailto://bshlegeris@gmail.com">me</a>.
