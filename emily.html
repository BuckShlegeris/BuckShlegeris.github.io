    <h1>Emily</h1>
    <p>I'm getting married to Emily, my girlfriend of about 2.5 years. Not everyone in my life has met Emily or knows her very well, so here's a brief history of her and my relationship with her. I've included some details that won't be meaningful unless you know about ANU courses, or the San Francisco Bay Area rationalist community.</p>
    <p>Here's the TL;DR. I met Emily at university and dated her there for a year, before moving to San Francisco for App Academy. We initially thought that we were going to break up then, but we quickly realized that we weren't satisfied with not dating, and we started planning to live together again. I moved back to Australia for a while and lived with her. Emily plans to move here and live with me.</p>
    <h2 id="before-dating">Before dating</h2>
    <p>Emily grew up in Broome, in Western Australia. Her family moved to Darwin when she was just entering high school, which as she points out makes hers the only family to ever move to the Northern Territory for the quality of the education. She stayed there until she was 18. If I had to pick my favorite stories from Emily's childhood, it would probably be how her family fostered a baby kangaroo named Spot, or how she worked in a wildlife park and spent time with baby crocodiles, which she thinks are adorable.</p>
    <p>I met her after she moved to Canberra for university. There was this extension to the intro physics course, called The Free Will Theorem, which was a weekly discussion-based class taught by David Chalmers, John Hutchinson, and Craig Savage, the first two of whom are reasonably famous and the last of whom is really cool but less famous. Emily and I were the two people who decided to attend this class even though we weren't getting course credit for it. So from the start, we heard a lot of each other's philosophical views.</p>
    <p>And we hated each other. Actually, I'm slightly more forgiving than Emily, so it would be more accurate to say that she hated me and I thought she was an irritating yet passionate lady who I would nevertheless love to sit down and talk with at some point. I wanted to approach her after class, but I was too scared to, so I didn't. (I also assumed she was gay and probably scarily feminist, as a result of her short hair.)</p>
    <p>But yeah, Emily <em>really</em> didn't like me. In fact, her dislike was so strong that it was interfering with her studies. You see, she and I were taking the same math and physics courses, and I often sat at the front of lectures or answered questions during them, so she had no choice but to be reminded of my existence. And she'd get so infuriated that she couldn't concentrate.</p>
    <p>Emily decided she was going to like me, just because disliking me was so personally costly for her. Luckily, she knows some psychology, and in particular she knows about cognitive dissonance. So she purposefully did me small favors whenever she ran across me, just so that her brain would assume that she actually liked me.</p>
    <p>This effort was assisted by her knowing Daniel Filan from a math tute, who she had a bit of a crush on: she had excuses to be around me occasionally just by chatting to him before lectures.</p>
    <p>One time, Daniel and I invited Emily to hang out with us for a while after one of Pierre Portal's fantastic Math1116 analysis lectures. We had a great time talking: she mentioned in conversation a boy who she had kissed, which I thought was exceptionally exciting news, and she was bemused by the diagrams of blu-tack I'd affixed to my wall. She had to leave to go to a physics lab, by which time I was convinced that I wanted to date her.</p>
    <p>One problem though: neither Daniel nor I actually knew her name. And at this point, we'd spent too much time together for me to be able to ask her. What could we do?</p>
    <p>Well, I knew that she had been in The Free Will Theorem, and I knew which physics lab group she was in. I happened to have recently written a Python script which takes a list of names and strips it down to the male and female names. For posterity, you can view it here:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/or3phmy7e6za019/facebook_friends.py?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/or3phmy7e6za019/facebook_friends.py?dl=0</a></p>
    <p>Man, I was so young then that I didn't even put spaces around my operators.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I took the class lists off the course website for The Free Will Theorem and the physics lab group which Emily attended, filtered them down to a set of female names with a variation of the above code, and took the intersection. There were only a few names in this set; I looked for each on Facebook, and eventually figured out that the girl I was looking for was named Emily Cutts Worthington.</p>
    <p>(Actually, my program came up with the name Emily Cutts. As always, it's a mistake to assume that people's names match <code>/[A-Z][a-z]* [A-Z][a-z]*/</code> .)</p>
    <p>And so began a mildly fruitful friendship.</p>
    <h2 id="dating">Dating</h2>
    <p>Now, Emily and I were both in similar situations with our families. As I said, Emily went to high school in Darwin, and I went to high school in Townsville. After Emily came to university, her family moved to Lennox Head, in northern New South Wales, and my family moved to Noosa, in southern Queensland. Neither of us knew many people where our parents lived.</p>
    <p>So after the Math1116 final, Emily told me that we should visit each other over the summer. This was pretty brave, given that she barely knew me at the time. I'm so incredibly glad that she did.</p>
    <p>I looked up her university ID on anupsearch, the command line tool to search for people at ANU, and sent her an email, in which I recommended Streetlight Manifesto, Coconut Records, and The Format as bands, and I recommended Three Worlds Collide and Scott Alexander's Consequentialism FAQ. We talked on the phone, where I recommended some of Brian Tomasik's essays. Then she came up to visit me.</p>
    <p>As soon as we got home, we walked across the street to the river of Lake Weyba. I'll let her narrate this bit: I'm here quoting from a letter she wrote to me as I left Australia at the end of 2013:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Our talks about philosophy were pleasant, and confirmed my belief that you were adorable, your explanations of compsci things were interesting, you were intelligent. There was also a river nearby, and I was pretty sure there were water birds that wouldn't let me touch them, and an adorable, intelligent boy who possibly would. I was correct on both counts.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>She told me that we should walk into the trees by the river, on the pretense that maybe we could find some birds.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Having herded/dragged you into a mildly secluded area and ascertained that there no small animals that would allow me to touch them, I touched you multiple times on the head to inform you that I would like to be kissing you. This did not produce the hoped for results. On the plus side, it was relatively warm and I was enjoying the smell of the forest (about half tree, half stagnant water). Also you have an extremely pretty face, soft hair, and lots of interesting ideas and opinions. So overall I was still pretty happy with the situation.</p>
    <p>[...]</p>
    <p>I don't know if you've had the experience where you are super aware of only one part of your body, as if all of your nerves had decided to move there so you could get the most sensation possible. The example I think is most likely to be common is when you've been injured painfully, or have an itch which you are unable to scratch. This is what it feels like for me when someone I really want to be touching me touches me, though the sensations are pleasant rather than painful or irritating. Slightly leg contact was therefore a both pleasant and frustration-building experience.</p>
    <p>At some point, though, I did end up touching your mouth with mine. Initially I was hoping to be about to describe this moment in some detail, but I was focused enough on the idea that a lovely human was kissing me that most senses not directly related to this were not processing at their normal level. As such, this is the end of the kissing section.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Emily and I talked for hours on the phone most nights from when Emily went back home to when I went to visit her. I was super excited by her.</p>
    <p>I convinced her over this time period that she should start studying computer science. Over the summer she taught herself the material from Comp1100, the intro CS course, at my encouragement. So when university started again, she wanted to do a later year course. She tried to get permission for Comp2300, a second year course on computer systems. She couldn't convince the lecturer to let her do it, so she convinced the lecturer for the third year Artificial Intelligence course to let her do that course instead. So her first CS course was AI.</p>
    <p>(Emily ended up doing her CS degree backwards. After she finished AI, she did a third year course in second semester. Then last year she studied some second year courses and a first year course. Right now, in her last semester at university, she's taking Comp1100.)</p>
    <p>Emily dyed my hair blue pretty soon into our relationship. We decided on the color by using a quantum random number generator, so that my hair would be different colors in different Everett branches. I think this was an important part of my transformation into my current crazier self, even though I've let my hair decay to natural colors at the moment--fixing it is on my to-do list.</p>
    <p>It was also around this time that I became interested in dressing well. Emily had a wide variety of colorful clothes, and we enjoyed figuring out crazy outfits for me to wear when I performed with my band.</p>
    <h2 id="apart">Apart</h2>
    <p>I moved to America in November of 2013 to do App Academy.  We initially planned to break up, but after about a month we decided that we quite missed each other and planned to eventually get back together somehow.</p>
    <p>A large part of my motivation in this was to get closer to the Less Wrong and Effective Altruism communities which I'd heard existed in the Bay Area. They certainly lived up to my expectations. I think that sixteen-year-old Buck would be very excited that I'd grown up to live in the Bay Area with so many of my intellectual heroes. I remember one time I was at an Alicorn dinner party with Scott Alexander, Eliezer, and obviously Alicorn and Mike, and I realized that between them probably more than 50% of my total teenage intellectual influence was sitting at the table. I've gotten a lot out of the Bay Area rationalist scene, and I hope that I've contributed a little to it as well.</p>
    <h2 id="dating-again">Dating again</h2>
    <p>In July 2014, I moved back to Australia to finish my degree, partially because I wanted to live with Emily again.</p>
    <p>This raised the question of whether I should live with Emily, and if so, where I'd live with her. I'm a pretty careful guy, and I certainly didn't want to sign a lease with Emily if we were going to break up at some point over the next four months. Obviously, I didn't feel like I was going to break up with her, but I am aware that twenty year olds have been wrong about that kind of thing before.</p>
    <p>So I did some research on the topic, which you can see <a href="http://bshlgrs.tumblr.com/post/90118681698/actuarial-tables-for-romantic-relationships">here</a>. A common criticism of social psychology research is that experiments are often only run on university undergraduates, because that's the demographic which psychology researchers have available. But that suited me just fine for the current question. My research led me to be pretty confident in the stability of my relationship with Emily.</p>
    <p>So I emailed Marion Stanton, the Head of Hall at Bruce Hall, which is the residential hall where I lived before moving to America, and I asked her if I could live with Emily in a shared couple's apartment. Marion responded, quite reasonably, by saying that those apartments were usually rented out to married couples, or unmarried couples a lot older than Emily and me. I replied to her saying that I'd thought through the risks quite carefully, and included a link to my research above. She was bemused, saying that she'd never seen someone hand her a researched essay with citations when she'd asked them about that before. So she gave us the room.</p>
    <p>I loved living with Emily for those four months. I was quite stressed by university at the time, but it was great to be with her in a queen sized bed. Emily's cooking is amazing; she created delicious vegan meals which I wish I could replicate. Inspired by Mike and Alicorn, we held dinner parties on Sunday nights, to which we invited a wide variety of my Canberra friends.</p>
    <p>Emily and I traveled to California together in December last year. I got a job, then she went back to Australia.</p>
    <h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
    <p>Emily has almost finished her degree: she plans to graduate in May. She's going to move to America as soon as we can push the paperwork through.</p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to living with her in the Bay Area again. I love living in the Bay Area. Emily is really special because she carefully considers her beliefs and morals, and then follows through on them. She was one of the first people who I knew in person who was really good with that. My favorite thing about the Bay Area is that most of my friends are really interesting in exactly that. I am happy to live in a place where everyone around me is a lot like Emily, and I look forward to doing do for the forseeable future.</p>
