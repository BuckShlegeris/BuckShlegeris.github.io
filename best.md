Here are my favorite things I've written.

**General:** I think we should [optimize dating for non-interference with platonic relationships](/2016/05/29/explicit.html). [Does availability of porn displace romantic relationships?](/2016/07/29/porn.html)

**Economics:** Why not make it [much easier](/2016/09/03/tax-percentiles.html) to price discriminate based on income, by making it feasible to explicitly charge prices as a function of income? Also, I [proved](/2016/10/07/optimal-tax.html) that if you have a population with logarithmic utility in income and linear in leisure time, and you want to maximize utility with a flat tax rate funding a universal basic income, you want to set the tax rate to 1 - harmonic mean of wages / arithmetic mean of wages.

**Software engineering:** I'm very proud of my work on finding a data structure for the [dynamic k-smallest problem](/2016/06/16/kth-richest.html). My solution involves some interesting properties of red-black trees, some non-obvious amortized cost calculations, and a kind-of-neat [generalization of the famous quickselect algorithm](/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html). Other things: [Hash ordered treaps are a neat data structure](/2016/07/02/hash-ordered-treaps.html). I made [a list of questions in Cracking the Coding Interview](/2016/06/22/ctci.html) which I think come up more in startup interviews.
