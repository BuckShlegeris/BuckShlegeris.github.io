Here are my favorite things I've written.

## Not software engineering

I thought about the ethics of saving vs improving lives [here](http://shlegeris.com/2015/08/08/value-of-life.html). I think that separating out the seller's price vs buyer's price of a life was a good idea. However, I did a bad job with the counterfactual reasoning in that post.

Others: [Does availability of porn displace romantic relationships?](http://shlegeris.com/2016/07/29/porn.html) I think we should [optimize dating for non-interference with platonic relationships](http://shlegeris.com/2016/05/29/explicit.html).

## Software engineering

I'm very proud of my work on finding a data structure for the [dynamic k-smallest problem](http://shlegeris.com/2016/06/16/kth-richest.html). My solution involves some interesting properties of red-black trees, some non-obvious amortized cost calculations, and a kind-of-neat [generalization of the famous quickselect algorithm](http://shlegeris.com/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html).

Others: [Hash ordered treaps are a neat data structure](http://shlegeris.com/2016/07/02/hash-ordered-treaps.html). I made [a list of questions in Cracking the Coding Interview](http://shlegeris.com/2016/06/22/ctci.html) which I think come up more in startup interviews.
