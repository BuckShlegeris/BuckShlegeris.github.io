In approximately descending order of interestingness:

I wrote a search engine for data structures; read about it [here](http://shlegeris.com/2016/11/13/ds.html) and try it out [here](http://ds.shlegeris.com/).

I [proved](/2016/10/07/optimal-tax.html) that if you have a population with logarithmic utility in income and linear in leisure time, and you want to maximize utility with a flat tax rate funding a universal basic income, you want to set the tax rate to 1 - harmonic mean of wages / arithmetic mean of wages.

I'm proud of my work on finding a data structure for the [dynamic k-smallest problem](/2016/06/16/kth-richest.html). My solution involves some interesting properties of red-black trees, some non-obvious amortized cost calculations, and a kind-of-neat [generalization of the famous quickselect algorithm](/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html).

We could make it [much easier](/2016/09/03/tax-percentiles.html) to price discriminate based on income, by making it feasible to explicitly charge prices as a function of income.

I think we should [optimize dating for non-interference with platonic relationships](/2016/05/29/explicit.html). [Does availability of porn displace romantic relationships?](/2016/07/29/porn.html)
