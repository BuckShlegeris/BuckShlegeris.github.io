    <p>Emily and I hold dinner parties on Sundays evenings, with a select group of 3-4 guests. The food is vegan.</p>

    <p>The parties are held in our room at Packard, at Bruce Hall. We live in room 3.09. If you aren't from Bruce, you need to get one of us to let you in. My number is 0448 012 654.</p>

    <p>Dinner is on the table at 6:30pm. Feel free to show up from 6, to get a head start on the entertaining conversations which shall be held throughout the night. We won't be offended if you need to leave promptly after dessert.</p>

    <p>Please don't feel the need to bring gifts or additional food to our dinner parties. Your presence is a sufficient addition to our evening.</p>
