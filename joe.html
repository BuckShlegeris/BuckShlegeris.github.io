<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>People often tell me I should care about the environment, and take steps to protect it. I'm on board with that in principle. However, before I spent a few hours researching this, I had no idea of how to judge how much environmental damage is caused by different things I'm doing, and which supposedly environmentally friendly measures I should bother taking.</p>
<p>For example, I'm aware that all the following things are costly to the environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>using water</li>
<li>using electricity</li>
<li>driving too much</li>
<li>purchasing plane tickets</li>
<li>not recycling glass</li>
<li>using lots of paper</li>
<li>throwing batteries into landfill</li>
<li>eating beef (this one's irrelevant to me because I'm vegan, but I know some people who don't eat beef for this reason)</li>
<li>donating to Cool Earth, which Katja Grace <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-11-14/less-burn-for-your-buck-part-ii">thinks</a> is the most cost effective way to reduce carbon emissions, at about $1.50 per tonne of CO2.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before I started researching this article, I had no idea how to weigh between these.</p>

<p>Central to my thoughts here is the Effective Altruism idea that we should try to use our time and effort in the most effective ways possible. I'm doing useful and fun things with my time, and I need to see some evidence for effectiveness of environmental choices before I can be convinced to displace my current behaviors. My time is worth about $40 an hour to me at the moment, and I don't want to take actions which aren't valuable enough to justify my time usage on them.</p>
<p>In particular, lots of these environmental concerns seem to just be normal economic issues. I'll talk about water consumption a bit more later, but it seems to me like a great example of an environmental issues which shouldn't really be considered as such. Water is a resource that I can choose to consume. I don't see any reasons why there would be large costs from my water consumption which don't factor into the price of water. I am totally on board with saving money by purchasing more efficient lighting for your dwellings, but that seems like a primarily practical matter rather than a moral one.</p>

<p>If you are an Australian citizen aged 18 or over, you are eligible to vote. But first you have to enrol – and you need to be careful you don’t miss your chance.</p>
<p>In many Australian States and Territories, you can’t enrol after the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/australian_electoral_system/Electoral_Procedures/Federal_Election_Timetable.htm" target="_blank">‘close of rolls'</a>&nbsp;which occurs shortly after an election is called – and that could happen without notice. If you don’t enrol by then, you won’t be able to vote in that election.</p>
<p>Don’t get caught out! It's important to have your say. Enrol now and be sure that you'll be able to cast your vote on election day.</p>
<p>Not sure if you are enrolled?&nbsp;<a href="https://oevf.aec.gov.au/" target="_blank">Check your enrolment</a>&nbsp;online.</p>
