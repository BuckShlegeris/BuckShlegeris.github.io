Hey, you know I fucked a Brazillian
Hey, you know I fucked a Brazillian
You know there's a Brazillian in my bed
Before we kissed, she asked about you
Whether our relationship was dead
And if cheating was really what I wanted to do

And I told the Brazillian girl
That you live so far away now
And we'll break up any day now
I don't want to hurt you
But you can't be hurt by what you don't know
And I'm a river my darling, and I've got to flow
And at the end of semester
She'll head home to Brazil.


You woke me up crying and you said
In a dream, you found someone in my bed
You found yourself rooted still
You couldn't find the anger to shout or kick
You just felt sad, and a little bit sick
When you woke up, you said I'd leave you for a girl from Brazil

And I did my best to reassure you,
"I'm as faithful as the moon
I'm waning off to Canberra,
but I'll wax and visit soon
I just might be tempted
By Brazillians on exchange
But I promise I'll stay faithful, girl,
and nothing has to change"

I talked so big about monogamy,
I told friends I'm with you to stay
But there's a Brazillian right in front of me,
And you're so far away

And I swore I wouldn't hurt you,
and I don't mean to cause you tears
But you are far, and she is near,
and you're in Townsville, she is here
You live in Townsville, she is here

I'm kind of sorry for the wrongs I've done to you, and
I'm kind of sorry for the deeds I've sung to you, and
I'm really glad I'll be sleeping warm
Cause that Brazillian girl is in my bed
I had your absence, and now I have her presence instead
And until the end of semester, I've got a girl from Brazil</pre>
