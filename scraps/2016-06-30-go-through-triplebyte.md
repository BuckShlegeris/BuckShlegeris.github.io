A few years ago, coding bootcamps suddenly made it much easier for people to transition into programming jobs. They help you learn to code, but they also give you a structured way of job searching--they help you with your resume, they give you interview advice, and they give you support when you start job searching.

I think that for a lot of people who want to transition to software engineering, you should consider studying harder on your own, applying to Triplebyte, and then only applying to a bootcamp if we reject you.

Obviously, Triplebyte has a bunch of advantages over bootcamps. To start with, we cost like $20k less. We're also a lot faster. We also generally place coding bootcamp grads in higher-paying jobs than coding bootcamps do, but that's mostly a selection effect.





I think that for a particular subset of people who would consider a coding bootcamp, you should instead just apply directly to Triplebyte.

One of the main things that coding bootcamps do is help you get jobs and make you look presentable; we make that unnecessary.

We let you get really good at the thing you'd rather get good at. For example, if you want to learn a shit ton about algorithms or machine learning, that's cool with us.


We've had great success recently working with academics. We've placed several mathematicians and we're currently working on placing a few biologists.

We are fine with accepting people who are really fucking good programmers even if they don't know anything about web systems or computer science. Note that you have to be *really* fucking good though if you want to get in based on raw coding skill alone.

If you're a mathematician and you can code, you can probably get in.
