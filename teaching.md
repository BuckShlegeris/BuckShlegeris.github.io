# Teaching

I sometimes work as a programming tutor. I charge $100 an hour. I'm particuarly good at helping people prepare for technical interviews. I love teaching functional programming and algorithms, and I can charge less for that.

## Programming resume

- First employee at Triplebyte. My job involves interviewing a wide variety of people; I was hired partially because of the breadth of my knowledge.
- I [presented at a programming conference](https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview) in 2015.

## Teaching experience

- I TA'd three different CS courses at ANU, in Python, Java, and Haskell.
- I TA'd at App Academy, teaching Ruby and Javascript
- At Triplebyte, I run interview preparation sessions over Skype. The teaching component of this mostly involves teaching algorithms and web system design.
- I have worked as a private tutor teaching Python and Scala.
