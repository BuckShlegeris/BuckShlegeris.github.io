Verse chords:

F            Eb               Dm               C#/Bbm         C/F
The fluff is falling and your heart is sinking down to the ground
          Bb        A/F   (notes) g# g  f#  F
Where the mounds of fluff are piled up like snow.

I still feel stupid whenever you look at me
Cause I was so full of naivity
When you kissed me almost two years ago

But when I see you round, can't help but notice you've stopped smiling
Now I think the time is right

*Cause the days and all the weeks are passing by
And your deadlines they are breathing down your neck
And now your pulse is getting quick
And maybe I
Will call you up and say
Even though it's late October
Don't the nights feel like they're getting colder
And if you need someone to hold you
Girl you know I could come over*

I spent my evening as I often do
With a photo of you
and a DSM-IV
and a note on my door
saying "I'm busy studying, do not disturb"

There's too much to learn, too many pages to turn,
Before I could tell myself
That I can get it right a time or two
Cause I've been thinking that

A little bit of competance is what I'd like to bring
Next time a friend is always wearing long sleeves in the spring
Cause I got a little closer, and I looked into your eyes
And I saw nicotene and THC and phenibut and SSRIs.


And maybe I'll come back and I'll find out that I'm forgiven
For the dodgy life advice I didn't realise I was giving
Singing "Girl, I'm sure you'll just get better, there's no need to see a doctor"
Now I'm waiting for your call, my girl, cause all the fluff is falling from the skyâ€¦


You hoped you'd change as you got older
That you'd get braver, you'd get bolder
But life has knocked you on the shoulder
And now it's scary when you're sober
And even though it's late October
Don't the nights feel like they're getting colder
And if you need someone to hold you
Girl you know I could come over
