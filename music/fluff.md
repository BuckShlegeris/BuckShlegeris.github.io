Intro chords:

F    Eb    Dm   Bbm/Db
F/C  Bb    F/A  g# g f#
F    Eb    Dm   Bbm/Db
F/C  Bb    F/A  g# g f#

Verse 1:

F            Eb               Dm               Bbm/Db         F/C
The fluff is falling and your heart is sinking down to the ground
          Bb        F/A   (notes) g# g  f#  F
Where the mounds of fluff are piled up like snow.
F            Eb     Dm           Bbm/Db
I still feel stupid whenever you look at me
               F/C     Bb
Cause I was so full of naivity
         F/A       (notes) G#  G    F G
When you kissed me almost two years ago


Prechorus 1:

G                                        Bb
But when I see you round, can't help but notice you've stopped smiling
       G
Now I feel the time is right
           Bb
Cause the days and all the weeks are


Chorus 1:
        F         A
passing by
                            Eb
And your deadlines they are breathing down your neck
             Bb
And now your pulse is getting quick
          F     A
And maybe I

Will call you up and say
Eb
Even though it's late October
          Bb
Don't the nights feel like they're getting colder
    Eb
And if you need someone to hold you
Bb
Girl you know I could come over


Verse 2, as verse 1

I spent my evening as I often do
With a photo of you
and a DSM-IV
and a note on my door
saying "I'm busy studying, do not disturb"

There's too much to learn, too many pages to turn,
Before I could tell myself
That I can get it right a time or two
Cause I've been thinking that

Prechorus 2, as prechorus 1:

A little bit of competance is what I'd like to bring
Next time a friend is always wearing long sleeves in the spring
Cause I got a little closer, and I looked into your eyes
And I saw nicotene and THC and phenibut and SSRIs.

Chorus 2, same as Chorus 1.

Then do the intro chords again twice:
F    Eb    Dm   Bbm/Db
F/C  Bb    F/A  g# g f#


Bridge:
    G                              Bb
And maybe I'll come back and I'll find out that I'm forgiven
        G                                   Bb
For the dodgy mental health advice I didn't realise I was giving
        G                                       Bb
Singing "Girl, I'm sure you'll just get better, there's no need to see a doctor"
        G                                     Bb
Now I'm waiting for your call, my girl, cause all the fluff is
                 F
falling from the sky


Chorus (just piano)

A                           Eb
And your deadlines they are breathing down your neck
             Bb
And now your pulse is getting quick
          F     A
And maybe I

Will call you up and say
Eb
You hoped you'd change as you got older
Bb
That you'd get braver, you'd get bolder
Eb
But life has knocked you on the shoulder
Bb
And now it's scary when you're sober
Eb
And even though it's late October
Bb
Don't the nights feel like they're getting colder
Eb
And if you need someone to hold you
Bb
Girl you know I could come over

Finish with intro chords.
