Super shitty recording [here](/files/brazilian.mp3).

```
Oh my conscience is eating me slowly
Tearing me up and I'm only
here for a couple more days

Oh my darling I'm so inconsistent
So close to making the distance
Now I can't look at your face

Now I can't look at your

faaaaa-a-a-aaaa-a-a-aaaa-a-a-aaaaaaace
Now I can't look at your face

Hey! You know that there's a Brazilian in my bed
Before we kissed she asked about you
Whether our relationship was dead
And if cheating was an okay thing to do

And I told that Brazilian girl that

You lived so far away now
We'll break up any day now
I don't want to hurt you, but
You can't be hurt by what you don't know
And I'm a river my darling, and I've got to flow
And at the end of semester, she'll head home to Brazil

(solo)

Remember when you woke me up crying and you said
In a dream you found someone in my bed
You found yourself rooted still
Because you couldn't find the anger to shout or kick
You just felt sad and a little bit sick
And you woke me up and told me that I'd leave you for a girl from Brazil

And so I did my best to reassure you
I'm as faithful as the moon
And I might wane right off to Canberra
but I'll wax and visit soon

And I will sure as be tempted
by Brazilians on exchange
But I promise I'll be faithful
and you know that nothing has to change

And I talk so big about monogamy
I tell my friends you're here to stay
But there's Brazilians right in front of me
And you're so far away

And I didn't mean to cause you tears
I know you're just sixteen years old
But you are far and she is near
You live in Townsville she lives here
You live in Townsville she lives here
You live in Townsville she lives here

You live so far away now! (We'll break up any day now)
I don't want to hurt you, but
You can't be hurt by what you don't know
And I'm a river my darling, and I've got to flow
And at the end of semester, she'll head home to Brazil
