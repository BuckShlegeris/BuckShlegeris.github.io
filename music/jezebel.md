Two recorded versions of this are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtrO5w3IsQA) and [here](https://soundcloud.com/buckmbs/jezebel).

```
Intro:

G      Em      Cm    G
I read Jezebel every day
       Em      Cm    G
I read Jezebel every day

        Em            Cm
I spell trans* with a star
            G         A
I know what privileges are
             F                    C
And when the lights go out you'll say
C   B   C    B   C   B C   B   C    B    C   B    C B C   B  A  G
How you wish you had a man who says that he reads Jezebel every day


Verse 1. Bass riff:

| G . . G | A B . C#' | . E' C#' C' | . E'  C' B |
| G . . G | A B . C#' | . E' C#' C' | . E'  C' B |
| G . . G | A B . C#' | . E' C#' D' | . F#' D' Eb' | . F#' Eb' E | . G E . |
| F . F . | F G A C   | . C  C   C  | C B   A  . |

You might have kissed him before, you can't remember his name
He smiles, you wink, and who could blame you
He's here for the same reason as you
To find somebody who
Has nowhere else to be tonight
And might as well be with you

Two repetitions of G, G, Em, Cm

(Back to initial bass riff)

Verse 2:

And he's a cute guy, and now he's trying to chat you up
And he's a douchebag, but he's probably a decent fuck
And with every word he's piecing through your flaws and insecurities
And hoping that the trick's he's learned

Prechorus 1:

     B                      C
From all the pick up artist books he's read
        B                          C
Will convince you to take him back to your bed
          B                 C
And you'd love to prove him wrong, but tonight
    B                      C
You might just prove him right.

Chorus 1:
                           Em                  A
But don't you ever get the feeling, though you understand you're a
       C                           G          F            Em
Strong independant white woman who just don't need no man
                   A                       C
The feeling, you'd rather kiss a boy who'd say

He reads Upworthy every day, he reads up worthy every day


Verse 3. The guitar part changes here. Now it's something like

E | G G G E | G . . . | . C# . C | . . . E |
| G G G E | G . . . | . C# . C | . . . E |
| G G G E | G . . . | . C# . D | . D D Eb | . Eb Eb E | . E E . |
| F . F . | F G A C   | . C  C   C  | C B   A  . |


Your tongue's in his mouth, and you're wondering if he
Thinks you're a shitty lock, and he's an awesome key
He probably thinks that you're some scumbag whore
So what the fuck are you worrying for?
If he can sleep with people he disdains, then why can't you?

Verse 4:

And your hands were tingling, but now they've turned to fists
Because he spent too many evenings on Chateau Heartiste
And now he speaks entirely in sexist quotes from misogynistic misanthropic pick up artist blogs

Prechorus 2, same music as Prechorus 1:

And even though you don't demand a man who must agree
On every item of feminist strategy
You'd at least hope for a lover
Who won't text beneath the covers
To tell all his friends he met online

Repeat chorus!

Then post-chorus ("da da da dah, da da dah, da da dah, dah")

G  | G  | em  | Cm |
G  | G  | em  | Cm |
G  | G  | em  | Cm | G | A |
F  | F  | C   | C

Then repeat Intro.

Then there's a guitar solo with no other instruments.

Then we do the Bridge, to the chord sequence of the prechorus (B, C)


You've grown up a lot since your pink princess days
You're a feminist now, but the truth cuts both ways
And you have learnd that you are not a damsel in distress
But you've also learned that you are not the prettiest

But he's the cutest guy who so far you've been able to see
And the proportion that you've looked at is more than 1 on e
And you have learned that compromise is something we all have to do sometimes
You grit your teeth and grab his face

And tell him to take you home, in the gap between songs
And he smiles with his teeth, like a hunter
whose prey has collapsed at his feet
And you hate feeling beat
        D                     B
But it's better than sleeping alone


Repeat chorus. Then repeat the post chorus. Then do the Intro chords and lyrics again, and you're done!
