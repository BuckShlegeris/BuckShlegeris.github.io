title: "If you touch my girlfriend..."
---

The girl who this is about gave me permission to sing and record it. I don't actually feel as negatively towards her as the song implies.

I feel bad for using the word "bitch" in this song--I disapprove of gendered slurs, and I think they're particularly harmful when complaining about your ex-girlfriend. But there really isn't a substitute that works nicely, and especially given that the girl in question gave the okay to the song, I don't feel too bad about it. I considered replacing "dick" with "bitch" when describing my behavior in verse 2, but I don't think that this would actually be particularly helpful.

Intro:
E   A   D   A
E   A   D   A

Verse 1:
E                       A  E                     A    E   B
I thought that I was an expert, the world’s best polyamorist
E            A  E           A   E         B
I’d read "Polyhacking" before I’d ever been kissed
E                           A  E                  A E         B
And when I fucked around in college, I never got jealous of myself
           F#m
But now my heart’s started beating just a little too fast
          D
And I can feel it when you walk past

Prechorus 1:
E
Cause now it's driving me mad
And it’s driving me insane
And I find it quite surprising how my blood pressure is rising
And I’m finding myself saying

Chorus 1:
A      E                        B
If you touch my girlfriend I’ll kill you
A      E                        B
If you touch my girlfriend I’ll kill you
A      E                        G            F#            B
If you touch my girlfriend I’ll find you and I'll kill you dead

Verse 2:
E             A       E          A     E         B
Maybe I’m too old for this shit, maybe Claire is right
E                    A       E          A         E/G#    G     B
That polyamory's not good for me, cause I wind up whining every night
E                     A    E       A       E       A         B
And I always cause my metamours an awkward pause because the force
  F#m                            D
Of jealousy’s too much for me to not act like a dick

Verse 3:
                             E                   A    E
And do you remember when she took a train to the east bay
           A  E          B
to go to a party at your house, and I was there
        E                 A    E           A    E/G#         B
And she kissed you on the lips and I threw up a little in my mouth
    E            A    E           A       E                          B
And I don’t even hate you, I just disdain you, and I think that your friends
            F#m
Are an ugly grabbag of monotone drone clone Yudkowsky-phones
D
growth mindset with no sign of growing, yet

Prechorus 2:
                 E
But maybe I’m as bad
Why the fuck else would she fuck you?
Why the fuck else would she decide that instead of a Buck in her bed
She wants a ?? ?? ?? motherfucker?

Chorus 2:

A      E                        B
If you touch my girlfriend I’ll kill you
A      E                        B
If you touch my girlfriend I’ll kill you
A      E                        G            F#            B
If you touch my girlfriend I’ll find you and I'll kill you dead
    A
And “The Ethical Slut” is a book I have read
       F#
I keep “Opening Up” by the side of my bed
        A
And she broke up with me and you know what I said?
                  B
“I don’t have the time for pining after every bitch from Santa Barbara, fuck no!”
