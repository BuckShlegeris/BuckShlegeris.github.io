These are guesses, obviously I have no idea what I'm talking about.

- Lots of bands make their live shows sound like their records in w
- Lots of bands make their live shows sound like their records in ways that make the shows way worse. Examples:
  - Heavy delay on the vocals--this just means I can't understand any of your lyrics if I'm listening to you in a venue with shitty sound (by which I mean basically any venue)
  - Playing along to prerecorded tracks--this makes the show feel way less energetic. It's better to have a thinner mix than to have the audience not see where sounds are coming from.
  - Relatedly, I think it's way more fun when bands arrange songs in ways that let them play all the parts live, because it's fun to be in an audience where you can see how all the music is being made. Eg when the Jeff Rosenstock band plays "The Fuzz" and does the amazing switch between the keyboards in the intro and the full band (0:35 in the album version). Similarly, at a recent Charly Bliss show I really enjoyed how they swapped instruments to play their guitars and synth in whatever ways required for the song. Another example--glockenspiels are super fun because it's super easy to see what someone's doing when they're playing them.
  - In general, you should try to make your arrangements thinner when live, because you have way less control over the sound.
- I think that more bands should try to make their music have interestingly varied musical content. That is, I think most bands write their songs and then stop too early--after writing one or two hooks they fill the rest of their songs with filler which they justify to themselves as "atmospheric" or "grooving". I think most bands would be better off if they tried to be less atmospheric and more constantly interesting.
- I think it's worth the time for songwriters to study the songs of songwriters who use crazy music things, so that they can learn to use those.
  - Part of this is that I think many successful songwriters use much more complicated musical devices than average songwriters, so it seems reasonable to try to learn to use more complicated musical things.
    - Billy Joel's songs have lots of crazy chord sequences
    - Jeff Rosenstock has way more interesting chord sequences than most competing bands, and way more interesting bass and drum parts.
    - PUP has weird irregular timings (eg Guilt Trip)
- Relatedly, I think it's worth it for instrumentalists to try to become really technically proficient; when I learn how to play instruments better I think of more creative things to do with them, and given that it's easy to get better at instruments it seems like it's worth it
