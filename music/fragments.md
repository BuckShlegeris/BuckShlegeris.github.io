## Miss your face

I heard you got a boyfriend, I met him on the weekend
I wasn't sure what I should say

## New York

I don't know if she sleeps through the night many nights anymore

My girlfriend thinks I should move to New York, but my friends are all here
I know nobody there.



My girlfriend says I should move to New York
But I don't want to have to wear a suit and tie to work
She says for that much money I'm just going to have to deal
And I don't know if that's how I want my girlfriend to feel



My girlfriend says I'll fit in well enough
And my work will be worth it when


My girlfriend thinks I should move to New York for the great philanthropic salaries
My girlfriend thinks I should move to New York for the sky-high trader salaries
My girlfriend wants me to throw out our future for


## Sleep debt

I spent my evening badly


You sent a sad emoji



Cause you've been sleeping badly, staying up late
Saying you'll make it up on your winter break
And when your sleep debt has been repaid
Maybe then you'll talk to me



Cause you've been sleeping badly, staying up late
Saying you'll make it up on your winter break
And when your sleep debt has been repaid
Maybe then you'll talk to me
You've just got too much shit to do
And lately time's been killing you
And maybe after all your shit is due
Then I'll talk to you
And talk to everybody else
About the things I should have done
Back when I thought we were in love
