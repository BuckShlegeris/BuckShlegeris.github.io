<p>There’s an old dumb objection to effective altruism, nicely summarized by <a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6i/ben_kuhn_on_the_effective_altruist_movement/">Ben Kuhn’s story</a> of the first time that he ran across what would become the EA movement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was a sophomore in high school (that’s age 15 for non-Americans), Peter Singer gave his The Life You Can Save talk at my high school. He went through his whole “child drowning in the pond” spiel and explained that we were morally obligated to give money to charities that helped those who were worse off than us. In particular, I think at that point he was recommending donating to Oxfam in a sort of Kantian way where you gave an amount of money such that if everyone gave the same percentage it would eliminate world poverty. My friends and I realized that there was no utilitarian reason to stop at that amount of money–you should just donate everything that you didn’t need to survive. <br />
So, being not only sophomores but also sophomoric, we decided that since Prof. Singer didn’t live in a cardboard box and wear only burlap sacks, he must be a hypocrite and therefore not worth paying attention to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This objection is kind of silly: Peter Singer almost certainly does more good with his current attire than he’d do living in a cardboard box and wearing burlap sacks.</p>

<p>But I worry that this objection is weak enough that it has a <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/">cowpox-of-doubt</a>-like effect on our ability to seriously consider the stronger version of this argument: that many of us could be doing more, and we don’t really have a principled excuse not to. To quote Ben Kuhn some more, I’m worried that I’m <a href="http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique#abstract">pretending to try rather than actually trying</a> to do as much good as I can possibly do.</p>

<p>Lots of EAs have argued against pushing yourself too hard. I think that their arguments are sort of correct but somewhat miss the point. A short sampling:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Effective altruism is a marathon, not a sprint.</strong> This is often given as an argument for why EAs should be careful to avoid running themselves too hard: they’ll do more good if they’re around for the long haul. I am somewhat sympathetic to this</li>
  <li><strong>Moderation in EA helps with PR/recruitment.</strong> To start with, this is only a good excuse if you’re notable among non-EAs or expect to become so. It also seems like there’s probably not going to be a shortage of EAs who aren’t very hardcore; if we ever need to profile people, we can presumably use those people. It’s also pretty easy to pretend to work less hard than you do if you want to–just say that you spend your weekends hiking and hanging out with your friends instead of admitting you were studying AI safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>The obvious extra problem here is that our lives are all nicer if we don’t make arguments like the one I’m making here.</p>

<p>I don’t think that we should make sacrifices which seriously endanger our mental health over the long run, unless such sacrifices seem like a really good idea. But I think that we should be willing to talk openly about which sacrifices are more or less safe.</p>

<p>For example, I love playing music and writing music. I spent almost no time last year playing music because I was busy and didn’t have friends around to play with (I wasn’t particularly trying to be self sacrificing with this). This didn’t leave me feeling burned out, it just meant that I was missing out on a major source of joy, and that when I look back on 2015 I have many fewer good memories than I would have had if I played more.</p>

<p>I think that that’s what the sacrifices I should make look like. They don’t look like me giving my kidney away. They look like me neglecting things that I love in favor of other things that are more important.</p>

<p>I’m reminded of this dumb fake Winston Churchill quote I see on Facebook sometimes:</p>

<p><img src="/winston.jpg" align="middle" style="width: 50%" /></p>

<p>I’m worried that I’m being as dumb and shortsighted as the fake Winston in that quote.</p>
