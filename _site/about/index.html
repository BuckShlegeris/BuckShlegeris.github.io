      <h1 id="buck-shlegeris">Buck Shlegeris</h1>

<div class="lead">
   <p>I am a software engineer from Australia. I have lived in San Francisco for most of the last three years. I'm interested in data structures and effective altruism.</p>
   <p>I work at <a href="https://triplebyte.com?ref=bshlgrs.github.io">Triplebyte</a>.</p>
   <p>I make fun music like <a href="http://soundcloud.com/buckmbs" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I studied computer science and physics at the Australian National University for two years. At the end of 2013, after completing enough courses to get a computer science major, I moved to San Francisco for App Academy. After the nine week course, App Academy offered me a job as a TA. I worked there until returning to Australia for university in June. You can read an interview I did about App Academy <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy">here</a>.</p>

<p>After graduating, I moved back to SF; I worked for PayPal in Scala for most of a year, then left to work at Triplebyte.</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Within computer science, my main interests are advanced data structures, programming language implementation, and functional programming.</p>

<p>I recently tried to <a href="/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html">exhaustively catalogue solutions</a> to problems of the form “given a set of data structures, find the $latex k$th smallest item in their union”. I love data structures which can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, such as augmented binary search trees. I hate interview questions <a href="/2016/04/22/dumbest-algorithm-problem.html">like this one</a> which use pseudo-algorithmic problems as an excuse to ask people useless brainteasers. I like thinking about algorithmic problems which result from taking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bshlgrs/posts/10207757972162021">simple games like Connect-4</a> and seeing what happens when you make them much larger. Occasionally my interest in polyamory crosses over with my interest in algorithms, <a href="/2015/08/08/poly-np.html">with amusing results.</a></p>

<p>You can play <a href="/music-game">this game</a> which I made to practise relative pitch, or <a href="/math-game">this game</a> which I made to memorize the relationships between different types of functions in real analysis.</p>

<p>I recently worked with Michael Dickens on a quantitative model for cause prioritization. You can try the model <a href="http://mdickens.me/causepri-app">here</a>. This project started out entirely motivated by desire to estimate cost-effectiveness of different non-profits, and somehow ended up as the most interesting algorithm design problem which I’ve ever needed to solve for a practical purpose.</p>

<h3 id="ruining-the-coding-interview">Ruining the coding interview</h3>

<p>One of my most interesting programming projects is an effort to automatically choose fast data structures, given a description of the API they need to support. You read a full descripion on <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview">GitHub</a>, or in this talk I gave at Scala By The Bay 2015:</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rtrO5w3IsQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I write songs and used to play them with my band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bucketal">Buck et al</a> in Canberra.</p>

<h2 id="effective-altruism">Effective altruism</h2>

<p>I’m a utilitarian and care a lot about making the world better.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m mostly trying to do good by <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">earning to give</a>.</p>

<p>I’m involved with the effective altruism movement, which has sprung up in recent years around organizations like <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> (of which I am a member), <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Center for Effective Altruism</a>. I regularly attend the Stanford effective altruism meetups.</p>

<p>In 2015, I was on a panel at EA Global in Mountain View.</p>

<p>I wrote about the biggest effective altruism mistakes I made in 2014 and 2015 <a href="/2016/05/24/mistakes.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Last year, I differentiated the equation <code class="highlighter-rouge">happiness = log(income)</code> with respect to income, and tried to use this to decide how much we should be willing to spend to save a life. You can read the disappointingly non-robust results <a href="/2015/08/08/value-of-life.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="donation-history">Donation history</h3>

<p>Since I started working, I’ve donated $48560.</p>

<p>In 2014, I donated about 10% of my income. In 2015, I donated about 30%. Here’s a complete record:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
<tr>
   <th>Date</th>
   <th>Amount</th>
   <th>Target</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>6 May 2014</td>
   <td>$60</td>
   <td>Machine Intelligence Research Institute</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>30 June 2014</td>
   <td>$500</td>
   <td>Vegan Outreach</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>11 July 2014</td>
   <td>$500</td>
   <td>80,000 Hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>11 July 2014</td>
   <td>$4000</td>
   <td>Animal Charity Evaluators</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>23 October 2014</td>
   <td>$1000</td>
   <td>Animal Charity Evaluators</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>5 September 2015</td>
   <td>$2500</td>
   <td>Machine Intelligence Research Institute</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>31 December 2015</td>
   <td>$40,000</td>
   <td>my donor-advised fund</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I donated to a donor-advised fund at the end of 2015, because I was unsure about
where I should donate. I am still figuring out where to donate it.</p>
