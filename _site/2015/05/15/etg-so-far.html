      <p>I’ve been earning to give since early 2014. I think I’ve made some good decisions and some serious mistakes so far.</p>

<p>The donation opportunity landscape was very different in 2014. It already seemed pretty obvious that global poverty probably wasn’t funding constrained anymore, because Good Ventures was rich and happy to spend tens of millions on bednets. But Holden seemed to not care about animals, and he seemed excessively skeptical of x-risk reduction. EA was growing rapidly, and it seemed inevitable that a lot more money was going to get involved, but it wasn’t at all clear to me whether much of that money would be targeted towards x-risk or animals. (I knew that GiveWell was interested in things outside global poverty, but it wasn’t clear that they wanted this to be their main focus long term.)</p>

<p>I identified pretty actively as an animal-focused EA back then: I <a href="http://bshlgrs.tumblr.com/post/90910214488/ambition">wrote</a> “I currently want to oppose speciesism, but could be convinced to work on existential risk instead.”</p>

<p>I donated my $5000 to Animal Charity Evaluators in 2014 basically because I thought EA was going to grow a bunch, and I wanted to make concern about animals relatively more prominent in the movement, reasoning that it would be cheaper to do this before EA was more popular. At the time, I didn’t really think about whether I should consider donating to far future organizations instead. (I also donated $500 to Vegan Outreach, $500 to 80,000 Hours, and $60 to MIRI.) This was about 10% of my income–I didn’t earn that much because I only worked for about half the year.</p>

<p>I started working full time as a software engineer in 2015. In the first half of 2015, a lot more funding appeared for animals and x-risk reduction. In January, FLI announced Elon Musk’s $10m donation to AI safety research. In June, GiveWell announced that they were starting a factory farming project which would be donating $5m a year. GiveWell’s interest in x-risk also became clearer to me.</p>

<p>This changed my calculations a lot. I became less interested in funding animal stuff. I trust the Open Philanthropy Project’s judgement a lot, and Good Ventures has a lot of money. I also thought that when the Open Philanthropy project started making animal welfare donation recommendations, it was plausible that some of the “we don’t know enough about animal interventions to fund them” crowd would shift their donations away from global poverty to animals. (This doesn’t really seem to have happened much yet; plausibly animal EAs aren’t working hard enough to cannibalize this funding.)</p>

<p>I also started to feel like there was less room for my donations in the far future space. I thought that I possibly still had a comparative advantage over OpenPhil at funding good AI safety research, because I thought OpenPhil and FLI might end up funding things I thought were less valuable–maybe they’d fund work on technological unemployment or similar things, or maybe they’d be irrationally biased against weird-sounding organizations like MIRI. However, my opinion of OpenPhil increased through the later half of 2015. This was largely because Claire Zabel started working there and spoke highly of it. I trust her judgement and we have similar values, so this was very persuasive to me. The other major factor is that OpenPhil hired several people whose opinions on x-risk I trusted, including Nick Beckstead, Luke Muehlhauser, and Daniel Dewey. Also, I got to know Howie Lempel a little more and he gave me more confidence that OpenPhil cared about the future and animals properly.</p>

<p>Michael Dickens thought a bunch about cause prioritization in mid 2015, and wrote a piece on it that I quite liked. He ended up donating to Raising for Effective Giving. I think his reasoning at the time was quite good.</p>

<p>I waited until the end of the year and I still wasn’t sure where I should donate. So I put my money in a donor-advised fund to grow until I had better information. (I also donated to $2500 to MIRI in September to take advantage of my PayPal donation matching.) I haven’t yet donated it anywhere.</p>

<p>What lessons have I learned?</p>

<h3 id="mistakes">Mistakes</h3>

<p>In hindsight, I think I did some things right. I pretty quickly decided global poverty charities are a bad use of money. At the time, the best argument against donating to AMF was that it seemed super plausible that reducing animal suffering would be much more cost effective than saving lives in the third world, just because factory farming is so awful and at such a massive scale. It wasn’t obvious that any particular intervention to reduce animal suffering was more cost effective, but I would have given more than 50% credence that in a few years we’d know about an intervention for animal suffering which is 10x more cost effective than the best global poverty intervention. (I was right: by OpenPhil’s numbers, corporate campaigns for welfare reforms are probably about 10,000x more cost effective than AMF.) Given that belief, saving my money for a few years while we waited for more information on factory farming interventions seemed to be obviously better than giving to AMF immediately.</p>

<p>I thought that funding ACE would help animal rights be more prominent in the EA movement, and help us to be faster at allocating donations to better interventions. I don’t know if this was correct. Now that OpenPhil is in the preventing-animal-torture business, ACE’s continued success seems somewhat less vital for the continued health of concern for animals within EA (as much as I appreciate ACE’s work). But I didn’t know that OpenPhil was going to do this.</p>

<p>I have a lot of regrets though. I should probably have donated to MIRI in 2015.</p>

<p>It was only a small donation, but I think it’s obvious in hindsight that MIRI in 2014 was a better donation target than Vegan Outreach.</p>

<p>Thing I was right about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not global poverty</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I was wrong about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The animal charity ideas I supported weren’t very good.</li>
  <li>I should have realized that getting a good picture of OpenPhil’s values and personality was vital to my own plans</li>
  <li>I should have thought more and earlier about cause prioritization in 2015.</li>
  <li>I was kind of taken by surprise when it started looking like EtG was a bad idea; I should have been thinking of that as a plausible possibility which I should be planning for.</li>
