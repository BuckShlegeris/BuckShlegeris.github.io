Hey $NAME

It was fun talking to you today!

Here are the notes I promised.

[ ] There aren't that many of them, which is probably a good sign :)

[ ] - Algorithms
  [ ] - I know these are annoying, but it totally makes sense to study up on them.
  [ ] - My favorite general algorithms resource is the Algorithm Design Manual
  [ ] - Here are the basics you should definitely know:
    [ ] - [Binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
      [ ] - I mentioned the isometry between binary search trees and B-trees. If you want to learn more about that, I recommend [this great set of slides](web.stanford.edu/class/cs166/lectures/05/Small05.pdf)
[ ] - Low level systems

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

Buck
