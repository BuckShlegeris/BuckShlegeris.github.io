# Time until singularity

Nick Bostrom did a poll [1] about expert predictions of future progress in AI. There's a reasonable amount of agreement between experts that AI will reach human levels in about 2040-2050, and get to superintelligence less than 30 years afterward.

I'm currently 20. Mortality tables [2] suggest that 20-year-olds have a 93% chance of making it to age 51, which will be 2045. That number doesn't take into account the fact that I'm healthy, don't smoke or drink, and seem to have a family history of longevity. It also doesn't take into account the magical new medical technology which will probably be invented before now and 2045, or the medical technology which human level AI might be able to invent.

If I do some overly simplistic arithmetic, I get an expected arrival time of superintelligence as 2075. Those same mortality tables reckon I have a 47% chance of living until then.

I think that 30 years is an oddly large takeoff time. I can much more easily envisage the scenario known as "hard takeoff, where AI takes hours or weeks to get from human level to superintelligence. However, it's a bit inconsistent for me to only use expert opinion as evidence when I agree with it. 

Regardless, this stuff really matters. I reckon that death-by-UFAI is a pretty likely cause of death for me.

(BTW, I'm excited about Bostrom's new book "Superintelligence". I've only read the preface and flicked through the rest, but what I saw was very insightful.)

Percentage of people who make it to 20: 98,680
Percentage who make it to 51: 92,093, so 93% chance.
at 81: 46,376, so 47%.
