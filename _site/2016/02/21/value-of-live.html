    <p><strong>Throughout this essay I ignore flow through effects, non human animals, and effects on the distant future, even though I don’t discount those in my personal altruistic decisions. Feel free to expand this analysis if you want to include those factors.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Obvious disclaimers: I think it’s a dumb idea to kill poor people. Also, well being varies for reasons other than poverty.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TL; DR: If we’re choosing between spending money on saving lives and reducing poverty, we need to consider how to compare the happiness created by saving a life to the happiness created by increasing the consumption in a society. Differentiating an estimate of happiness as a function of income lets you estimate the happiness created by increasing marginal consumption. If you assume happiness is logarithmic in income, then the dollar amount at which you’re indifferent between saving a life and increasing total consumption that much increases as income * log(income). My numbers suggest that AMF is a much better charity for hedonic utilitarians than GiveDirectly.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes it’s useful to be able to put a value on a human life. To use a crass metaphor, these days human lives go for about $3400 if you want to buy them from AMF. That’s the seller’s price. I’m interested in calculating the maximum price at which we should be interested in <em>buying</em> human lives.</p>

<p>One way of defining this “buyer’s price” of a human life is the maximum price at which we as a society would rather save someone’s life than just keep the money. People are happier when they have higher consumption. If I could save the life of one American, but reduce American GDP by 10%, I’m pretty sure that would overall not be a good trade.</p>

<p>So we need to have a way of comparing the damage done by reducing the consumption of an economy by some amount of money to the damage done by someone in the economy dying.</p>

<h2 id="logarithmic-happiness">Logarithmic happiness</h2>

<p>It’s pretty common to approximate happiness as linear in the logarithm of consumption. Average happiness in a population where everyone has income y can be written as:</p>

<p>average happiness = $latex \log y + k$</p>

<p>where $latex y$ is income and $latex k$ is some constant. If people have a life expectancy of $latex t$ years, then we have the total happiness-years of a person as $latex t \log y + t k$.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-theoretically-about-latex-k">Thinking theoretically about $latex k$</h3>

<p>The biggest judgement call in this essay is that $latex k$ constant. $latex k$ tells us about the consumption level at which a life is so meagre and deprived that it isn’t worth living. The income at which a life has 0 value according to the above formula is $latex 10^{-k}$. So if you think that life isn’t worth living if you’re consuming less than $1000 a year, then you think $latex k$ is -3.</p>

<p>Imagine we decided that living on $100,000 a year is twice as much fun as living on $10,000 a year. This would mean that $latex log 100000 + k$ is twice as much as $latex log 10000 + k$. So $latex k$ would be -3. If we thought poverty was not as bad as that, then maybe we’d be saying that living on $1,000 a year is half as good as $10,000. In that case, $latex k$ would be -2. I think that the first of those is probably truer, so this is another argument for estimating $latex k$ as about -3.</p>

<p>Maybe we should be concerned by this, because more than a billion humans have less than $1000 annual consumption. I have a few thoughts on this. To start with, it seems plausible that the purchasing power parity adjustment I’m using isn’t powerful enough. It’s cheap to have a place to sleep in rural Malawi, much more than it is in America. If there were a Malawian rural town within commuting distance of my office in SoMa, I’d be ecstatic to pay $200 a month to live in a thatch-roofed hut there. (I’m not kidding: I lived on an air mattress on the floor of my office for six months last year.) There are lots of really cheap goods available to Malawians, like thatched roof huts and really cheap shitty rice, which are unavailable to me but make it much more easy to live cheaply.</p>

<p>To some extent, I’m willing to buy that living in SF counts as bonus consumption, because I’m closer to fun things, but mostly I just live here so that I can work here, which feels more like an employment-related expenditure than consumption to me. So maybe I don’t buy that as someone with an annual consumption of $30k, I’m really getting 40 times the consumption in my life as the average resident of Malawi.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vwtxhtjokdokvcx/Poor-Economics.pdf?dl=0">Poor Economics</a> tells the story (starting on page 20) of this guy called Pak Solhin who was extremely poor. He used to live on $2 USD PPP a day, until he lost his job, after which he lived like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pak Solhin himself survived on about 9 pounds of subsidized rice he got every week from the government and on fish that he caught from the edge of a lake (he could not swim). His brother fed him once in a while. In the week before we last spoke with him, he had had two meals a day for four days, and just one for the other three.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That life is being classified as significantly less than $2 PPP a day, which I don’t think includes the benefits of free rice, his brother’s food, or fishing in the river.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to trivialize extreme poverty here: that life sounds pretty shit, and I’m incredibly glad I don’t have it. But I don’t think it’s entirely sensible to call that “living on $1 a day”.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I get the benefits of a lot of government spending which Malawians don’t: I have subsidized public transport, and reasonably good police, and good roads, and so on.</p>

<p>I do believe that it’s possible for someone’s consumption to be low enough that their life isn’t worth living. If you told me that I was going to have to work extremely hard on unpleasant tasks in order to eke out enough income to be only hungry most of the time, like Pak Solhin, then I’m not sure that I’d say that my life is worth living. I can imagine that if I had to live on $50c of food a day, with San Francisco prices, and I couldn’t get medical care or other entertainment items, my life might not be worth living.</p>

<p>Here’s another fact about consumption levels and happiness. Under most natural circumstances, if you consume very small amounts, then you aren’t really sad, you just die from hunger or overexposure. In fact, the consumption levels at which my happiness function predicts your life isn’t worth living is actually pretty close to where I’d imagine that you’d die from hunger if we were really adjusting for PPP correctly. This is either incredibly interesting or a surprising coincidence. I am interested in hearing speculation about this.</p>

<p>The variability of consumption also plays into this. If it costs you a dollar a day to not die of hunger, then if your monthly income has a standard deviation of 50c per day, I suspect you’d die in a few months. So even if the lowest survivable level of poverty is bad enough that your life is barely worth living, perhaps not many people will live at that level of poverty for long.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this model of happiness as logarithmic in income is good but gives bad results for extremely poor countries, because we are underestimating the consumption of extremely poor people.</p>

<h3 id="numerically-estimating-latex-k">Numerically estimating $latex k$</h3>

<p>Here’s a few data points to use to estimate $latex k$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A few weeks ago I was talking to this dude who grew up in poverty in Mexico and illegally immigrated to America when he was 12. We chatted about his previous quality of life for a while: not getting enough food, only getting one pair of shoes a year, and so on. My impression is that his life in Mexico seemed about half as worth living as his life here is. From his description of his quality of life, and my understanding of Mexican poverty, I would guess he was living on maybe $4000 a year. I wish that I’d thought to ask him for a numeric statement of how much better his life here was, but I didn’t think of this. Next time.</li>
  <li>Slate Star Codex <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/30/utility-weight-results/">did a survey</a> trying to calculate the relative quality of life in different situations. Respondents thought that Ethiopian life is 50% as good as American life, and Chinese life was 85% as good.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a lot more averse to poverty than SSC readers, apparently.</p>

<p>From these <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofwjlxGFlgG7cVnuySiga8yApl6AWLDlyZPa-c5ZHRc/edit?usp=sharing">we get an average estimate</a> of $latex k$ as about -3.2. This number is low enough that nations with average consumption PPP less than $latex 10^{3.2} = 1585$ are classified to have a negative quality of life.</p>

<h2 id="monetary-value-of-a-life">Monetary value of a life</h2>

<p>Anyway, back to the math. The derivative of this function with respect to income is $latex \frac{1}{y}$. So if we reduce the size of an entire economy by some small amount $latex \Delta y$ evenly spread across the whole population of n people, then the reduction in happiness per person is:</p>

<p>$latex \Delta \text{happiness per person} = \frac{\Delta y}{y n}$</p>

<p>but there are $latex n$ people, so the total reduction in happiness is:</p>

<p>$latex \Delta \text{total happiness} = \frac{n \Delta y}{n y} = \frac{\Delta y}y$.</p>

<p>So if we have the option to spend $latex \Delta y$ to save a life, we should be indifferent to doing so if the total reduction of happiness caused by reducing the total income by $latex \Delta y$ would be the same as the happiness of a given person:</p>

<p>$latex t (\log y + k) = \frac{\Delta y}{y}$</p>

<p>We can solve this for $latex \Delta y$:</p>

<p>$latex \Delta y = y t (\log y + k)$</p>

<p>Now we can substitute the value we chose for $latex k$ above to figure out that America should be willing to spend up to about $6.6 million to save an American baby:</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Is it really sensible to say that some places have a negative value of a marginal life? I think it is. Most obviously, imagine a prison (or factory farm) where everyone is starving and cold and so unhappy that their life isn’t worth living. In this prison, we’re better off with fewer suffering people, so it isn’t worth even $0 to save a life.</p>

<p>Some people are much more reluctant than I am to say that lives aren’t worth living, often (I think) because they’ve spent less time than I have thinking about factory farming. Those people might be better served by some other model of human happiness as a function of consumption; I’m not sure what it would be but I’m interested in seeing it.</p>

<p>So one interpretation of these numbers is “the price at which we are indifferent to decreasing total consumption by that much to save a single life”. Another interpretation, though, is “the price at which saving a single life is better value for money than just increasing consumption by that much”. This is really important, because as philanthropists we have the option of doing both of these things, most obviously through GiveDirectly and AMF.</p>

<p>I can’t do these calculations on Malawi, because Malawians have lives that aren’t worth living according to this model, which as I said above I think is because the consumption of Malawians is underestimated. I’m going to do this estimate on Keyna instead, because that’s where GiveDirectly works.</p>

<p>Kenya has a PPP-adjusted GDP per capita of $3,138. My formula above suggests that this means that we should be willing to buy a Kenyan life for at most $56771. This implies that if AMF worked in Kenya instead of Malawi, it would have a much better direct effect than GiveDirectly does. GiveDirectly doesn’t work in Malawi, so we can actually make this comparison by just considering how much worse a life in Malawi is than a life in Kenya. If a Malawian life is half as good as a Kenyan life, then we should be willing to spend like $27k to save one, which is still way way more than the price at which AMF seems to save human lives. This sounds like a resounding recommendation for AMF over GiveDirectly to me.</p>

<p>Maybe there are flow through effects of cash transfers which increase consumption more. It does seem like many people in poor places are underemployed. ASK DANIEL ABOUT FLOW-THROUGH EFFECTS</p>

<p>GiveWell has obviously thought about this question. In 2012 they said that they suspected AMF was a <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/">much better deal</a> than GiveDirectly. However, GiveWell hasn’t tried to quantify the value of increasing consumption vs saving lives like I have here.</p>

<p>There are some slightly sketchy steps in my reasoning here. The dodgiest step is where I said that I didn’t believe in the PPP consumption estimates of extremely poor countries. However, I think that this line of reasoning is unavoidable if you want to compare saving lives to improving lives by increasing consumption.</p>
