    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-23T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 23, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/18/poor-kids-who-do-everything-right-dont-do-better-than-rich-kids-who-do-everything-wrong/">This article from 2014</a>, with the provocative title “Poor kids who do everything right don’t do better than rich kids who do everything wrong” is terrible. It makes a shitty and misleading graph, and makes a variety of nonsensical judgements based on it.</p>

<p>The graph used makes it really hard to see what the actual distributions of overall income are. If you make, say, a bar graph of the income distributions, you’ll see that poor college grads do much better than rich high school dropouts. I made such a graph (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/112K9ejdFQMPcnvEqERT2k2Oe7Tk7zJ-YHFuA3LikFRA/edit?usp=sharing">here’s the spreadsheet</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/img/poor-college-grads.png" alt="Bar chart" /></p>

<p>I also estimated the average incomes of both groups based on the given statistics, and found an average income of $78k for the poor college grads and $60k for the rich high school dropouts.</p>

<p>The main piece of evidence that this blog post uses to support its thesis is: “Specifically, rich high school dropouts remain in the top about as much as poor college grads stay stuck in the bottom — 14 versus 16 percent, respectively. Not only that, but these low-income strivers are just as likely to end up in the bottom as these wealthy ne’er-do-wells. Some meritocracy.”</p>

<p>The first of these statistics is not clearly related to meritocracy. If you want high income mobility, you want both these numbers to be low. The sentence is phrased as if it’s bad that the numbers are similar; that doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>The second of these statistics is correctly interpreted, but seems cherry-picked: I could just as easily point out that 41% of poor college grads end up in the top 40% of income, while only 19% of rich high school dropouts do. To prevent such cherry-picking, we should probably use the Schelling point summary statistics like mean income or median income, both of which indicate that the poor college grads are doing <em>significantly</em> better.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the original paper didn’t do anything wrong, this “reporter” just decided to make up some bullshit conclusions from the statistics. This is even worse than most reporting–the mistake isn’t something you have to read the original source to find, the mistake is right there in the graph that Facebook is suggesting as the image preview. Alas!</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/10/20/libertarians.html"> Left-libertarianism</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-20T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 20, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I know a lot of people who identify as left-libertarians, or bleeding-heart libertarians, or whatever. Scott argued for this position <a href="slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/">here</a>. Gary Johnson has <a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GaryJohnson1-1.jpg">posed wearing a Bleeding Heart Libertarians shirt</a>. A lot of rationalists and EAs seem to think of this as the political position of utilitarians who are aware of the benefits of free markets but also the costs of externalities and inequality.</p>

<p>I don’t think that these people realize how much their values conflict with classic libertarianism. Most importantly, if you’re one of those EA left-libertarians, you should AFAICT probably support way more redistribution than we currently see, and you would probably overall prefer to expand the total share of GDP controlled by the government.</p>

<p>I’m like 70% sure that from a utilitarian perspective which is just optimizing for the short-term welfare of humans and not particularly other animals or the far future, you want to increase redistribution. This guess is based on looking at the US federal budget and noting that a lot of the money goes to direct transfers or various public services. If you kill all of the government spending libertarians don’t like and then increase redistribution as much as utilitarians would probably want to, I suspect that government spending would get bigger overall. This isn’t even including the possibility of redistribution to other countries–if we’re allowed to do that, I think that government would be way bigger than it is now.</p>

<p>Most libertarians would definitely not be cool with this. Given this redistribution preference, it’s not clear to me that the utilitarian left-libertarian position is closer to the Libertarian party than the Democrat party.</p>

<p>This all assumes that I’m right that we should have more income redistribution. But even if we should only have current levels of redistribution, libertarians probably aren’t on board with a future with tax rates as high as they currently are.</p>

<p>Why do EA left-libertarians identify so closely with libertarians? I think it’s a few things—they haven’t thought about the extent of optimal redistribution, they find libertarianism aesthetically appealing and less ideologically grating than leftism or conservatism. There are also some topics where many libertarians and utilitarians get along pretty well–most of the support for the Open Borders movement seems to come from libertarians. But I think it’s more based on aesthetic preferences than actual policy alignment.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/10/07/optimal-tax.html"> Optimal redistribution with a flat tax</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-07T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 7, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>Suppose you have a bunch of people differ only in their wage <script type="math/tex">w</script>. Everyone has utility logarithmic in their consumption. As the government, you want to promote welfare by redistributing consumption. You decide to do this by instituting a flat tax and using it to fund a universal basic income.</p>

<p>The more revenue you raise with your tax, the higher the UBI can be. But if you raise the tax too high, you will excessively deter people from working. So what’s the optimal tax rate?</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, Ben Weinstein-Raun and I managed to find an analytical solution to this problem. The optimal flat tax rate is a simple function of the wage distribution:</p>

<p>$^$\text{Optimal flat tax rate} = 1 - \frac{\text{Harmonic mean of wages}}{\text{Arithmetic mean of wages}}$^$</p>

<p>The functional form checks out: Harmonic mean equals arithmetic mean on a set which is perfectly equal; in that case the fraction will be 1 and the tax rate will be 0. Inequality causes the harmonic mean to become smaller than the arithmetic mean; at most, the fraction might go to 0 and the tax rate will approach 100%.</p>

<p>Another way of phrasing that fraction is “the average time it takes for someone to make a dollar, multiplied by the average wage”.</p>

<p>I did most of the algebra in Sympy; almost all of the math I write here is replicated in <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/economics-demos/blob/master/python/optimal_tax.py">this Python script</a>, which I also put online as a Sage workbook <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/0a4323fd-9bc8-4276-a48c-cb0de6ecf3fe/files/2016-10-11-195016.html">here</a>. Because of that, I’m reasonably confident in this result.</p>

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>Let’s define all our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">w</script> is the wage of an individual</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">r</script> is 1 minus the tax rate</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">h</script> is the amount of time that a person works, in some unit. The units don’t affect the optimal tax rate.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">c</script> is the UBI</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">u</script> is utility</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">y</script> is the pre-tax, pre-transfers income of an individual, <script type="math/tex">Y</script> is the income of all of society</li>
  <li>there are <script type="math/tex">n</script> people. The set of people is <script type="math/tex">P</script>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So individuals have utility <script type="math/tex">u = \log(w \cdot h \cdot r + c) - h</script>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-individual-behavior-as-a-function-of-r-and-c">What is individual behavior, as a function of <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">c</script>?</h3>

<p>First we find the optimal hours worked for an individual by differentiating utility with respect to hours worked:</p>

<p>$^$\frac{du}{dh} = \frac{w \cdot r}{w \cdot h \cdot r + c} - 1$^$</p>

<p>Setting the derivative to 0 and solving for <script type="math/tex">h</script>, you get</p>

<p>$^$h = 1 - \frac{c}{r \cdot w} $^$</p>

<p>Let’s check functional form–we expect workers to work more if they have lower UBI, lower taxes, or higher wages. This function has all those behaviors (remember that <script type="math/tex">r</script> is the proportion of your income you get to keep, not the tax rate).</p>

<p>The optimal income is that time multiplied by <script type="math/tex">w</script>, so:</p>

<p>$^$y = w - \frac{c}{r}$^$</p>

<p>Note that this means that everyone forgoes the same amount of income due to the distortionary effects of the UBI and taxes.</p>

<p>At this income, utility for an individual is:</p>

<p>$^$u = \log(r) - 1 + \log(w) + \frac{c}{r\cdot w}$^$</p>

<p>And utility over all of society is therefore:</p>

<p>$^$U = n\cdot\log(r) - n + \sum_{p \in P}\log(w_p) + \frac{c}{r\cdot w_p}$^$</p>

<p>We can rewrite this to</p>

<p>$^$U = n\cdot\log(r) - n + \sum_{p \in P}\left[\log(w_p)\right] + \frac{c}{r} \cdot \sum_{p \in P} \left[\frac{1}{w_p} \right]$^$</p>

<h4 id="total-societal-income">Total societal income</h4>

<p>Given <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">c</script>, the income of the whole population is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
  Y &= \sum_{p \in P} y_p \\
   &=  \sum_{p \in P} \left(w_p - \frac{c}{r}\right)
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Conveniently, the <script type="math/tex">\frac{c}{r}</script> term is constant in the sum, so we can take it out:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
 Y  &=  - \frac{n \cdot c}{r} + \sum_{p \in P} w_p \\
    &=  -\frac{n \cdot c}{r} + W
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>where the total wage of the whole population is <script type="math/tex">W = \sum_{p \in P} w_p</script>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-c-given-r">What is <script type="math/tex">c</script>, given <script type="math/tex">r</script>?</h3>

<p>At a given tax rate <script type="math/tex">r</script>, the UBI (by definition) is:</p>

<p>$^$c = \frac{1-r}{n} \cdot Y $^$</p>

<p>We can substitute the other expression we found for <script type="math/tex">Y</script> above into this equation:</p>

<p>$^$c = \frac{1-r}{n} \cdot \left( -\frac{n \cdot c}{r} + W \right) $^$</p>

<p>and solve for <script type="math/tex">c</script>, which gets us</p>

<p>$^$c = \frac{-r \cdot W \cdot (r - 1)}n$^$</p>

<p>So given a tax rate, we now know the equilibrium UBI.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-u-given-r">What is <script type="math/tex">U</script>, given <script type="math/tex">r</script>?</h3>

<p>We can now substitute the equilibrium UBI into our global utility formula to determine global utility at this tax rate:</p>

<p>$^$U = n\cdot(\log(r) - 1) + \sum_{p \in P}\left[\log(w_p)\right] - \frac{\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right]\cdot W\cdot(r - 1)}n$^$</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-optimal-choice-of-r">What is the optimal choice of <script type="math/tex">r</script>?</h3>

<p>Now we differentiate <script type="math/tex">U</script> with respect to <script type="math/tex">r</script>:</p>

<p>$^$\frac{dU}{dr} = \frac{-\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right] \cdot W}{n} + \frac{n}{r}$^$</p>

<p>Set this to zero and solve for <script type="math/tex">r</script>, and you get:</p>

<p>$^$\frac{n^2}{\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right] \cdot W}$^$</p>

<p>Remember that <script type="math/tex">W</script> is the sum of wages. So this can be written as</p>

<p>$^$\frac{n^2}{\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right] \cdot \sum_{p \in P}\left[w_p\right]}$^$</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208780739570567&amp;set=a.1254922647920.38754.1075180788&amp;type=3">posted on Facebook</a> asking for someone to make sense of this expression for me. Matt Alger and Ben Weinstein-Raun both figured out that it is the harmonic mean of the wages divided by the arithmetic mean of the wages.</p>

<p>So overall:</p>

<p>$^$\text{Optimal flat tax rate} = 1 - \frac{\text{Harmonic mean of wages}}{\text{Arithmetic mean of wages}}$^$</p>

<h2 id="further-questions">Further questions</h2>

<p>I am interested to see if this process could be extended to find optimal tax structures for other situations. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens if people have different levels of avarice: that is, some of them get more pleasure from money than others?</li>
  <li>What happens if leisure time has diminishing marginal returns?</li>
  <li>What about if we don’t want to be restricted to a flat tax? Can we solve for the optimal tax function, where a tax function is a function from different pre-tax incomes to post-tax incomes?</li>
</ul>

<p>I should also look harder to see if my result here is already known in the optimal tax literature. My impression is that economists aren’t that interested in this particular question, because they don’t like the rigidity of my assumed utility function. But I still think this result is really neat, and I’m very glad to know it.</p>

- **Sheshinski, 1971: ["The Optimal Linear Income Tax"](http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/Sheshinski_(REStud_72).pdf)**. This discusses a more general version of the problem, where we have a flat tax but utility isn't assumed to be logarithmic in consumption and linear in leisure.
- **Slemrod et al, 1992: ["The optimal two-bracket linear income tax"](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/31813/0000759.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). This doesn't contain this result.
