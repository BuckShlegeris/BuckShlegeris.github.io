<div class="lead">
<p>I am a software engineer from Australia. I have lived in San Francisco for most of the last three years. I'm interested in data structures and effective altruism.</p>
<p>Here are some things that I've written recently:</p>
</div>


  <h2><a href="/2016/09/03/tax-percentiles.html"> Should we encourage price discrimination based on income?</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-03T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 3, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>Here’s a crazy half-baked economics idea:</p>

<p>As a society, we could make it easier to discriminate prices based on income. We could set up a system where it’s easy for businesses to have pricing schemes like “This coffee costs $3 for people with income $20k or less, and costs $6 for people with income $130k or higher, and we linearly interpolate between those two prices for people whose incomes are somewhere in the middle.” This could be implemented with credit cards which automatically pay in this way, such that the person selling the coffee doesn’t see your income.</p>

<p>To clarify, I’m not suggesting that the government should <em>force</em> anyone to use this, and I’m not suggesting that they even encourage it. I’m just proposing that the IRS should set up a system to <em>allow</em> companies to do price discrimination in this way.</p>

<p>What effect would this have?</p>

<p>I think it’s likely that willingness to pay for coffee correlates with income. So I suspect that even though they don’t have to, coffee shops would start to use this kind of pricing scheme. This would result in lower prices for poor people, higher prices for rich people, and higher profits for coffee shops. This would probably also increase the number of coffee shops, because the increased profits would mean that the fixed cost of a coffee shop was going to be justified more places.</p>

<p>I don’t think rich people could do anything about this, any more than we can do anything about other price discrimination schemes. The only reason this currently isn’t a thing is that there are high transaction costs on it.</p>

<p>This would obviously end up transferring money from rich people to poor people. The exciting and dangerous feature of this is that after this system was established, no-one controls the level of redistribution.</p>

<p>One other feature/bug of this system is that it would probably make it easier to infer people’s incomes. This would be a big change but I don’t see any reasons that you couldn’t have a society where people mostly know how much money everyone else is making.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Some counterarguments:</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t some companies not adopt this, and then rich people would prefer those companies?”</p>

<p>I don’t think so. Suppose other companies are doing this, and you decide to try and compete by not adopting this. What price level should you set? Well, poor people obviously aren’t going to be buying from you, so they’re right out. So the profit maximizing price is going to be higher than it otherwise be. So the rich people still have to pay more.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t this just result in increased prices for the rich and not decreased prices for the poor?”</p>

<p>I suspect prices would drop a <em>lot</em> for poor people on items where there’s low marginal cost and high fixed cost, eg coffee shops or software or music. Many goods and services have high fixed cost and low marginal cost; those goods would have discriminatory pricing models.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>This is a fun example of a redistributive policy which theoretically doesn’t require a government to do anything except enforce contracts. I think it’s legal to ask people to sign a contract where they state their taxable income for the previous year and promise they’re telling the truth. So a company could set this up without any government intervention at all.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2016/09/03/printers.html"> Printers and price discrimination</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-03T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 3, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>I’m reading “Modern Principles of Economics” by Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen. I’m really enjoying it—it’s engagingly written and even though I’ve learned most of the material before, I keep learning fun little things.</p>

<p>Here’s my favorite tidbit so far. Printer companies usually sell printers relatively cheaply and set high prices on toner. Similarly, game consoles are usually sold cheaply, with the cost recouped by sales of games. Why is this? (Note that in both cases, the goods are “tied”: there’s competition between Xbox and Playstation on both console prices and game prices, but Xbox games can only be played on Xbox—-Microsoft and Sony aren’t competing on price for games on the other’s console.)</p>

<p>There are a bunch of reasons which are probably true to some extent but aren’t as interesting, so I’ll quickly mention them. Maybe customers are fooled by the low printer price and then get suckered into paying more for the toner. (But often companies buy printers and you’d expect them to take both prices into consideration. And there’s competition between printer companies, so maybe customers should be able to learn to buy the printers with cheaper toner after enough trips to the printer shop where they see cheaper options on the different toner brand.) Or maybe consumers have higher time discounting than companies, so this is effectively a small loan from the company to the consumer.</p>

<p>I’m interested in an explanation which isn’t about that kind of factor. You should think about this yourself, because I think it’s really fun!</p>

<p>Here’s a hint:</p>

<p>It’s about price discrimination. Printer companies would love to charge higher prices to people who want their services more, and charge lower prices to people who want their services less.</p>

<p>And here’s the answer:</p>

<p>People vary in how much they want printers. One way of guessing how much value someone derives from a a printer is seeing how many pages they print. So people who print more probably derive much more value from a printer than people who don’t print very much. Setting a high price on toner and a low price on printers lets you effectively price discriminate so that people who get more value from your product pay you more for it.</p>

<p>Isn’t that neat! It’s obvious once you think about it but I’d never thought about it before.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2016/08/30/white-dudes.html"> Privilege and polite disagreement</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-08-30T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Aug 30, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p><strong>Content warning/TLDR: It’s usually unreasonable to demand that people calmly discuss topics which are personally charged to them. However, I think that it’s praiseworthy to be able to discuss these topics, and I want people to be better at not thinking of their political enemies as monsters. In this post I say that people should consider the possibility that they are wrong about things.</strong></p>

<p>Kelsey <a href="http://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/149677505536/blacksentai-white-dudes-have-this-thing-whereg">recently wrote</a> about this Tumblr post:</p>

<div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/yzU0nbutjSBa1PPY9a_vlw/54504046421" data-did="1b7d89912eddb689ed82f44f9af4a0866d4adf5e"><a href="http://blacksentai.tumblr.com/post/54504046421/white-dudes-have-this-thing-where-they-believe">http://blacksentai.tumblr.com/post/54504046421/white-dudes-have-this-thing-where-they-believe</a></div>
<script async="" src="https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>

<p>I interpret this somewhat differently than she does.</p>

<p>I think the author is making two closely related but distinct claims.</p>

<p>The first claim is that when you’re privileged, many fewer discussions are viscerally upsetting, and you might not realize that other people might get really upset about things you’re discussing lightly. So we should bear this in mind when we’re talking about potentially upsetting topics, and we shouldn’t look down on people for being unwilling or unable to discuss these comfortably.</p>

<p>There’s a whole host of reasons why I agree with this. In some cases, people are justifiably afraid of imminent violence from people with particular prejudices, and want to avoid people who have a particular opinion. In a lot of other cases, particular conversations make them feel really uncomfortable. A software engineer friend of mine said that people who think women are worse at programming just tend to be extremely unpleasant company for her, and she’s never met one who had enough positive qualities to override that negative one. And, like, just in general I think people should be allowed to opt out of conversations they don’t want to have, unless there’s a good reason to expect them to have the conversation.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I think the post kind of makes a second claim, though, which is that it’s not actually admirable or desirable for people to be able to talk to someone who disagrees with them on issues that the two of them care a lot about. And this one I strongly disagree with.</p>

<p>Here’s why I think it’s good to be able to talk dispassionately about things which matter a lot to you. To start with, I think that moral progress occurs more quickly when people who disagree can talk to each other and learn why they disagree. I think a good example is made by the OP writing about people who think that they “don’t deserve health care”. I suspect that the OP is talking about disagreements over how to fund healthcare. I think that’s an extremely inaccurate and unfair summary of the position that the OP’s talking about.[1]</p>

<p>I totally believe that when someone says they don’t think America can afford a single-payer solution, the OP hears that as the person saying that they don’t deserve healthcare. And again, the OP doesn’t have an obligation to talk to people who stress them out. And it’s probably harder not to get stressed out by these conversations when you feel more threatened in your daily life, because of poverty or whatever other reason. But the end result is that to make life easier for themselves, the OP has sacrificed their ability to change their mind or change anyone else’s mind on this. That’s a cost that might be worth paying, but it’s worth remembering that it’s definitely a cost.</p>

<p>(Just in general, I think it’s worth erring on the side of trying to convince people of facts rather than values. A few quick reasons I believe this: Fact-spreading is more co-operative. In political discourse, a lot of things can either be viewed as factual disagreements or value disagreements, and I think that trying to think of them as factual disagreements is a useful exercise for increasing your politeness and persuasiveness. And if you spend a while learning about facts to argue with someone, I think you’re possibly more likely to have learned something useful than if you spent that time trying to write emotional appeals to convince third parties that the person you’re arguing against has an abhorrent belief.)</p>

<p>I think this kind of attitude elevates intolerance of political beliefs to a virtue. Posts like this one tell the OP’s friends that their political enemies are monsters who literally believe that “native children should be ripped away from their cultures and people”. This post tells the OP’s enemies that the OP has no idea about why people disagree with them, and it makes the OP’s enemies quite reasonably less enthusiastic about taking the OP seriously in future. Social groups naturally have an evolutionary pressure to make themselves more insular, and hating outsiders is the kind of thing that they’re always going to be drifting towards; I want to oppose that trend, not encourage it.</p>

<p>So I think there are two very different claims the post is making. I think the reason that the post doesn’t distinguish between them is that they can be phrased very similarly: “it’s unreasonable to expect oppressed people to be able to dispassionately discuss political disagreements which personally affect them” is a sentence which could be taken to mean either claim.</p>

<p>In general, it’s always a subtle and difficult point to say that X is non-optimal but also we shouldn’t force people to not do X if they really want to. I wish English were better at expressing this.</p>

<p>[1] I’m not actually totally sure about this. I think that if you examined people’s System 1 beliefs about, for example, public health care for poor black people, you’d find that a good proportion of them are actually thinking of some “welfare queen” stereotype. I think it’s worth not describing this kind of disagreement as a value disagreement, though. If you asked the person to explain their belief, they’d probably end up revealing some empirically false belief they have about what it’s like to be poor and black.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2016/08/24/armchair.html"> The Armchair Economist on moral philosophy</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-08-24T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Aug 24, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>I read a chapter of The Armchair Economist today. It’s an engagingly written book.</p>

<p>Here’s one passage I found particularly interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now let me return to that dollar bill whisked away by the New Orleans wind. I knew that if I let that dollar get away, it would land in a place where it would never be found—it would be as good as burned. What were my options?</p>

  <p>Option One is to kiss the dollar good-bye. The cost-benefit accounting: I lose a dollar, the rest of the world gains a dollar through falling prices, and the world as a whole is neither richer nor poorer than before. The consequence for economic efficiency: None.</p>

  <p>Option Two is to grab the dollar, exerting approximately three cents’ worth of effort. (That is, three cents is about what I would have been willing to pay my friend David to retrieve the dollar for me instead of grabbing it myself.) The cost-benefit accounting: I lose three cents, the rest of the world neither gains nor loses, and the world as a whole (including me) is three cents poorer. The consequence for economic efficiency: A decline. By a purely selfish accounting, losing the dollar is costlier than grabbing it. But if I let the dollar go, my losses are offset by others’ gains. If I grab it, my (substantially smaller) losses are not offset by anything. The logic of efficiency compels me to let it go.</p>

  <p>Or does it? Let me distinguish between two quite different propositions. One is that economic efficiency should be an important consideration in resolving issues of public policy. The other is that economic efficiency should be an important consideration in resolving issues of personal conduct. It is only the first of these propositions that economists frequently defend. Like most people, economists are vocal when they criticize governments but coy when they criticize each other.</p>

  <p>The efficiency criterion treats everybody equally. A cost is a cost, no matter who bears it. In the realm of public policy, this is an appealing feature. But in our private affairs, it seems odd to insist that we should behave as if our own concerns carry no more weight than those of distant strangers. There are times–as on that day in New Orleans–when I think that efficiency fails entirely as a guide to how I should behave. But there are other times when it serves me pretty well. When my lawn gets shaggier than the neighbors would prefer, I have to ask myself whether I am morally obliged to take action. In the process, I think about what it would cost me to get the lawn mowed, and how unhappy I think the neighbors really are. If it seems likely to cost me $30 worth of effort to save the neighbors from $20 worth of grief, I pour myself a lemonade and stop worrying. If I believe that with $30 worth of effort I could save the neighbors from $50 worth of grief, then I feel like a jerk until I mow the lawn.</p>

  <p>That’s an efficiency calculation, and it leads me to conclusions that feel right. I’m not entirely consistent about this. When I decide whether to operate an internal combustion engine or an aerosol can, I do care about the harm that I might do to others by damaging the air quality. I emphatically do not care about the psychic harm that I might do to others who are morally offended by the very idea of my operating an internal combustion engine or an aerosol can. I think that this distinction would be very hard to justify philosophically. If my driving makes you unhappy, then I have made the world a less happy place in a way that is independent of why my driving makes you unhappy. The strict logic of efficiency would say that if I am prepared to stay home rather than cause $10 worth of damage to your lungs, then I should also be prepared to stay home rather than cause $10 worth of damage to your moral sensibilities.</p>

  <p>I infer that although my moral philosophy is incomplete, efficiency considerations play a major role. But my last trip to Boston shook my faith a bit.</p>

  <p>I flew from Denver, with my wife, and our round-trip tickets totaled just under $2,500.I offered alternatives to the publisher who was footing the bill, but he insisted that we come anyway. Still, I’m sure that if I’d been paying my own way I would have canceled the trip.</p>

  <p>This led me to formulate the following moral dilemma: Suppose that getting to Boston and back is worth $300 to you. It costs the airline $200 to provide that transportation. But because of some extraordinary degree of monopoly power, the airline charges $1,000 for the ticket. Should you fly? If you care only about efficiency, then you certainly should. If you fly, you are worse off by $700 (the difference between what you pay and the value of the trip), while the owners of the airline are better off by $800 (the difference between what they collect and the cost of flying you). There is a net gain of $100 and the efficiency criterion pronounces the trip a Good Thing.</p>

  <p>Yet I am sure that I would not buy the ticket and I am equally sure that I would lose no sleep over it. I am sure that I would reach the same conclusion no matter how much the airline owners stood to gain, or how little I stood to lose. So while I still believe that efficiency is usually the right general guide to government policy, and often the right general guide to personal behavior, I now think that we need a much subtler criterion before we can really know what it means to be good. I believe that there are times when I ought try to behave efficiently and other times when I need not. I just haven’t figured out the rules for knowing which times are which.</p>

  <p>I did retrieve that dollar, without a moment’s concern for its effect on the general price level. I feel no guilt, though I’m not sure why.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2016/08/16/dumb.html"> Dumb ideas</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-08-16T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Aug 16, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>I often have ideas to do things that I know everyone else probably thinks are stupid. But I often like my dumb ideas. Using the inside view, my ideas seem very reasonable.</p>

<p>But given how stupid everyone else would probably think my weird proposal is, I’m willing to accept a Chesterton’s fence argument that I shouldn’t actually think I’m right. What I really want to do is discuss my weird proposal with someone.</p>

<p>This is kind of an embarrassing conversation to have though. In the past it has felt like an argument which I end up losing and looking dumb. “Hey there,” it feels like I am saying. “I know that this idea sounds weird but I don’t understand why it’s so weird and it sounds like a good idea to me. Now that I’ve convinced you that I’m an extremely clueless person, do you feel like arguing with me until I give up?”</p>

<p>I only noticed this pattern recently. In the past, I’ve dealt with this problem by not telling people about most of my stupid ideas, or only telling people who I don’t think are very smart (so that if they point out flaws in my ideas and I feel bad about it, I can beat them in an argument), or only telling smart people about them when I am more confident than usual that my idea is a good one (which is only a smallish fraction of my weird ideas; usually I am convinced that my idea is bad).</p>

<p>But now that I’ve identified this pattern, it’s less of a problem. I plan to explicitly call attention to the fact that my idea is probably bad. I will clarify that I am aware of the Chesterton’s fence argument against my current idea, and I probably won’t follow through with it until I’ve followed the usual Chesterton’s fence due diligence. I’ll explain that I’m mostly interested in discussing my idea because I want to improve my understanding of the world. Armed with loudly signaled humility, I will enthusiastically face the prospect of being corrected by my trusted friends and learning more about why normal things are normal!</p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>When I’m writing, I often find myself wanting to use formatting to express myself. For example, I like using bold font to emphasize my most important sentences.</p>

<p>This makes my writing look unsophisticated. If I asked my father, who is a good and traditionally-minded writer, about this, I suspect he’d say that you can communicate anything you need to without formatting, and needing formatting is sign of weak writing ability.</p>

<p>I think my father would be wrong. English is much richer as a spoken language than a written language. I’m constantly stymied as I write by my inability to express the pattern of stress in the sentences I’m writing. I end up having to write different sentences from the sentences I’d speak, because I’m effectively working with just the small subset of English which happens to lose relatively little information when you destroy one of its main components.</p>

<p>Formatting gives me back some of that expressive power, and I’m very grateful for that. I will continue using gratuitous bold font in my writing, and I’ll just deal with the hit to my perceived classiness.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2016/08/14/bootcamp-attendees.html"> My advice to people about to attend bootcamps</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-08-14T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Aug 14, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>An EA who’s going to be attending a bootcamp in a few months emailed me a few days ago asking for advice. Here is an edited version of our conversation.</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you are not yet employed as a programmer, you should focus intensely on getting a job, because it is a lot better to be a programmer than unemployed.</li>
  <li>To get a job faster, you should try to become a better programmer.</li>
  <li>To become a better programmer, you should do whatever programming practice is most entertaining and compelling to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s his email to me:</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>I'm curious about what you find to be the main (important) skills lacked by bootcamp graduates, and whether you have any advice on which one can acquire outside of a work environment.  Also, I'm wondering, as I will no longer be aiming to work at somewhere like Google, Slack, etc., should I put less emphasis on studying algorithms than I had been planning to?</p>

    <p>I'll be attending [a top coding bootcamp in a few months], and want to spend wisely the huge amount of free time I have before then.</p>

    <p>Should I shift some of the time I intended to spend on algorithm textbooks on general business books, books about design, and general books on problem solving and development, do you think?  Or is there something else that would be a better use of the next couple of months?</p>

    <p>I'm also curious whether you think it would be a waste at this point to spend a bunch of time learning about blockchains (after seeing whether I have an aptitude for this sort of work).</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And here’s my response:</p>

<hr />

<p>Hey there.</p>

<p>Here are some rough thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m curious about what you find to be the main (important) skills lacked by bootcamp graduates, and whether you have any advice on which one can acquire outside of a work environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bootcamp grads don’t tend to totally lack important skills, they’re just very junior. The best thing to do is to try to learn more about everything about programming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, I’m wondering, as I will no longer be aiming to work at somewhere like Google, Slack, etc., should I put less emphasis on studying algorithms than I had been planning to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Algorithms are covered in interviews at a lot of companies, including lots of companies where the day-to-day work is very practical full stack development. And for many people, implementing algorithms is a good way of getting better at programming. So my advice is to study algorithms even if you don’t plan to take a Google job. (<a href="/2016/08/14/algorithms.html">Here’s my advice on studying algorithms</a>.)</p>

<p>(FWIW, it’s probably worth applying to Google even if you don’t want to work there. Companies will move much faster with you if you tell them that you have a Google onsite scheduled, and they’ll be much happier to negotiate.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I shift some of the time I intended to spend on algorithm textbooks on general business books, books about design, and general books on problem solving and development, do you think? Or is there something else that would be a better use of the next couple of months?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s what I think your plan should be. First, <strong>do whatever it takes to get a programming job</strong>. This mostly involves useful things like getting good at programming, but it probably also involves some less immediately useful things like learning about algorithms. <strong>Getting a programming job should be your top priority</strong>, because after you get a job, you’re getting paid and you can claim that you’ve worked as a professional software engineer, which makes every subsequent job enormously easier to get.</p>

<p>I think that at this point, getting better at programming is higher value than getting better at any of those other things. (I’m also somewhat skeptical that you can get much better at those other things by reading books.)</p>

<p>How do you get better at coding? I think you should code as much as possible, and I don’t think it really matters what you code. It’s easiest for me to be productive and hardworking when I’m working on something that excites me. If that’s true for you too, then the biggest priority for you is to <strong>find something you enjoy working on and then work on it a bunch.</strong></p>

<p>I’m going to propose a bunch of different things you can do, all of which are worth your time. I think you should probably do whichever one you enjoy the most.</p>

<p>The first step is to get comfortable enough coding that you don’t get stuck all the time. (Analogously, I think that it’s really important when learning musical instruments to get good enough that playing the instruments is fun. <a href="http://www.jefftk.com/p/teach-yourself-any-instrument">Jeff Kaufman agrees</a>.) If you want to improve your coding fluency, you can do beginner things like Codecademy, which is quite well built to give you practice at writing simple, syntactically correct code. You already got into App Academy, so you’re probably beyond the level taught there. But if you’re ever demoralized and want something easy, learning the basics of a new language on Codecademy is a decent use of time.</p>

<p>Then you want to work on some coding projects. <a href="https://gist.github.com/bshlgrs/2363068d9775ca18390cee5fec279f3e">Here are some ideas I wrote down on this topic once</a>. Do whichever of those seems fun. If you want, you can send me code and I’ll comment on it for you. If you get stuck on weird bugs, take the opportunity to post on StackOverflow if that isn’t too stressful for you. Posting questions on StackOverflow is a great learning experience.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some other things you might be interested in doing. All of them are useful and you should do whichever one looks like the most fun. If you get stuck on one of these, email me or ask on StackOverflow about it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a simple-ish project (eg Connect–4) and implement it in multiple programming languages</li>
  <li>Learn to use Github Pages, and put a shitty personal website on it
    <ul>
      <li>Make little bits of Javascript and put them on your personal website.</li>
      <li>Learn some HTML and CSS. Learn to use Bootstrap</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Take a MOOC on algorithms. (I like the Roughgarden course).</li>
  <li>Learn Sinatra, try to make a simple web application with it</li>
  <li>Learn some C.</li>
  <li>Learn Haskell (this one is especially good if you like math)</li>
  <li>Read a textbook on algorithms. My favorite is Skiena’s Algorithm Design Manual, because I really enjoy the writing style.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have a coding job, start trying to learn whatever other stuff.</p>

<p>Re blockchain stuff: I think it’s worth your time to learn about it if and only if you find it interesting :) If learning about it gives you an excuse to practice more programming, so much the better.</p>

<p>Apologies for length; I wrote this partially because I wanted to take the opportunity to express all these ideas for myself, so that I can write them down for a larger audience at some point.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2016/08/14/algorithms.html"> My advice on studying algorithms</a></h2>

  <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-08-14T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Aug 14, 2016</time></p>

  <div class="shrink-headings">
    <p>Software engineering interviews often ask whiteboard algorithms questions. Here’s my advice on how to study for them. (My credentials on this topic are:  I have passed a lot of whiteboard interviews, including at Google and Apple;  as part of my job I prepare programmers for these algorithm interviews; I have conducted more than 200 technical interviews on programmers with a very wide variety of backgrounds.)</p>

<p><strong>I’m speaking for myself, not for Triplebyte, in this post.</strong></p>

<p>Other topics than algorithms are also covered in interviews. Triplebyte <a href="blog.triplebyte.com/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview">has a blog post</a> which has useful information on studying for those. I primarily intend this post to be a supplement to section 2 of that post.</p>

<h2 id="background-why-do-companies-ask-algorithms-questions">Background: why do companies ask algorithms questions?</h2>

<p>In real life, programmers spend almost none of their time implementing binary search trees or graph search algorithms. So why do companies ask so many questions about them?</p>

<p>There’s both a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Watsonian and a Doylist</a> interpretation of this question–“why are algorithms questions useful to companies to ask” has one answer, and “what is the actual causal mechanism by which companies decided to ask algorithms questions” has another.</p>

<p>I’ll start out by explaining the reasons to ask algorithms questions, and then move on to more cynical explanations for their prevalence.</p>

<p>To start with, a lot of professional programmers aren’t able to do very basic things. For example, I might have a list of Customer objects, each of whom has an array of Purchase objects, and I want to get the names of the five customers who have spent the most over the last week. My guess is that maybe 50% of professional programmers would not solve this problem within 30 minutes. You don’t want to hire such people by mistake.</p>

<p>Less pessimistically, when you’re interviewing someone for a programming job, you’re trying to find out how good they are at solving hard and confusing programming problems where they need to keep lots of details in their head at once. In real life, confusing complicated problems happen because you’re working on projects that are large enough to take weeks, and you need to think about a lot of different parts of software at once. But interviews don’t normally have enough time to let you get that deep into a programming problem. So instead of asking you a problem that is only difficult because of how large it is, they ask you questions which are short and difficult.</p>

<p>How can you come up with complicated but short coding problems which are also simple to describe? I think algorithmics is a good choice here. Algorithmics is the most complicated area of computer science that almost all software engineers know about, and it allows lots of easy-to-describe, tricky-to-implement problems.</p>

<p>Now here’s are some more cynical historical notes.</p>

<p>Interview processes are awkwardly sticky. Engineering teams are comprised entirely of people who passed the technical interview of that team. So everyone is personally incentivised to believe and say that their interview process is extremely accurate at measuring software engineering ability. So once a culture of algorithmic interviewing gets established at a company, it’s hard to change it.</p>

<p>Also, everyone knows that Google had an amazing team 10 years ago (and to a lesser extent still today), and Google asked algorithmic interview questions back then. Most companies are slightly insecure about not being Google (because they’re used to losing their best candidates to Google), so they are tempted to imitate Google’s interview process.</p>

<p>At worst, algorithms interviews can turn into some weird hazing process. Sometimes companies get totally convinced that some random brainteaser is the secret sauce to finding great candidates, and you can never change their mind about it.</p>

<p>Overall, I wouldn’t ask traditional hard algorithms questions in interviews. At worst, algorithms questions are extremely bad interview questions. I’ve written on occasion about <a href="/2016/04/22/dumbest-algorithm-problem.html">questions I particularly hate</a>. Algorithms questions are particularly bad when they’re more like brainteasers and require more leaps of insight. (If you want to build an algorithm interview process, feel free to email me and I can give you more detailed opinions on how to ask questions that don’t have these problems.)</p>

<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>

<p><strong>EDIT: I just read <a href="http://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/#general-study">Haseeb Qureshi’s blog post</a> about this again; he and I agree and I think he goes into slightly more detail. Read the “General Study Strategy” and “Programming Interview Study Guide” sections.</strong></p>

<p>I think there’s sort of two different skills involved in answering algorithms questions. Firstly, you need to know all of the classic algorithm and data structure material. Secondly, you need to be able to quickly produce algorithmic logic on a whiteboard under pressure. I’m going to discuss these topics separately.</p>

<h3 id="canonical-algorithms-material">Canonical algorithms material</h3>

<p>There’s a pretty consistent set of core algorithms knowledge to acquire that companies will test you on. Companies are incentivised not to ask questions relying on material which isn’t in this list, because many good programmers don’t know it and the companies will end up failing good people.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the data structures material you should know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List structures: arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists</li>
  <li>Set and map structures: hash maps, binary search trees, heaps</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the data structures, you should know how all of its essential methods are implemented and their runtimes. (Essential methods for lists are <code class="highlighter-rouge">set</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">get</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">pushAtEnd</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">popAtEnd</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">insertByIndex</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">removeByIndex</code>. Essential methods for sets are <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">remove</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">contains?</code>). You should know how to write code that uses the implementation of the data structures; for example, you should be able to implement a <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNearestElementTo(x)</code> method which takes a binary search tree and searches for the closest value to <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> in the tree.</p>

<p>Other notes on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should know that your binary search tree implementations need to have logic for balancing, but it’s okay if you don’t know the details. (Optional material: if you want to quickly learn an implementation of self balancing BSTs check out <a href="/2016/07/02/hash-ordered-treaps.html">treaps</a>. If you want to understand how red-black trees work, learn about <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf">left-leaning red-black trees</a> or 2-3-4 trees instead.)</li>
  <li>You should probably know that a queue <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/69436/1360429">can be implemented with two stacks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should be able to implement all of the following algorithms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graph algorithms: Breadth first search, depth first search, Dijkstra’s algorithm</li>
  <li>One fast sorting algorithm; I recommend mergesort or quicksort</li>
  <li>Binary search on an array. This one is super fiddly to get right and it’s worth writing the code even if you roughly understand the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be roughly comfortable with Big O notation.</p>

<p>How should you learn all this? My favorite resource is Skiena’s Algorithm Design Manual. All the above material is covered in chapters 2-6. I like it because the writing style is really engaging and it focuses on the parts of the material which I think are the most important. It’s available free on the internet <a href="https://github.com/addyrookie/Depot-App/raw/master/gmail/The%20Algorithm%20Design%20Manual%202ed%20%20by%20Steven%20S.%20Skiena.pdf">here</a>. One downside of this book is that it gives code examples in C, which makes it less accessible to programmers who can’t read C. If you read this book, I think it’s worth reading chapters 1-6 and chapter 12. This reading will cover quite a bit of material which is extremely unlikely to come up in interviews, but I think that the unnecessary material does a good job of reinforcing the really core stuff.</p>

<p>If you want a briefer explanation, I like the explanations in Craking the Coding Interview and on <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">InterviewCake.com</a>.</p>

<p>I think Skiena’s book is way better than the famous CLRS textbook, which is extremely dry and somewhat pedantic.</p>

<p>I have a few notes on graph algorithms <a href="/2016/07/02/graph.html">here</a> that might be a useful resource.</p>

<h3 id="canonical-algorithmic-skills">Canonical algorithmic skills</h3>

<p>So that’s the core knowledge required for interviews. Here are the different kinds of programming skills that are tested, together with my favorite resource for learning them.</p>

<p>Cracking the Coding Interview is an extremely useful resource for all of this. I wrote some notes on it <a href="/2016/06/22/ctci.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the most common central components of algorithms interview problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dynamic programming: learn it by reading Skiena chapter 8, or by reading the Cracking the Coding Interview chapter on this topic.</li>
  <li>Recursion: Cracking the Coding Interview has a great chapter on this.</li>
  <li>Iterating around and over the famous data structures. CtCI has good questions about this for each of the individual data structures. Eg for BSTs, you could refer to the CtCI tree chapter.</li>
  <li>Composing fast data structures for a problem. <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/data-structure-composer/blob/master/amazing_outcome.md">Here are some examples</a> of this kind of problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>My main advice is to do a bunch of problems from Cracking the Coding Interview. I listed in my notes on it the problems that I thought were most important.</p>

<p>Here’s a general note on studying these problems: I think it’s probably fine to “cheat” by reading the answers. I think you’re better off giving up on the problems and reading the solutions than giving up totally on doing practice interview problems.</p>

<h3 id="non-technical-aspects-of-succeeding-at-algorithm-interviews">Non-technical aspects of succeeding at algorithm interviews</h3>

<p>It’s worth practicing answering these questions under pressure, with a real human asking them to you. For more advice on this, see the <a href="http://blog.triplebyte.com/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview">Triplebyte blog post</a>, particularly points 2, 3, and 7.</p>

<h2 id="learning-further-about-algorithms-and-data-structures">Learning further about algorithms and data structures</h2>

<p>Suppose you’re excited about algorithms and data structures for their own sake, as opposed to for the mercentile purpose of getting a job. How should you learn more?</p>

<p>The easiest things to learn more about are relatively simple data structures that for whatever reason aren’t part of the core data structure canon I described above. For example, <a href="/2016/07/02/hash-ordered-treaps.html">treaps</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">skip lists</a>, <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs231/fall09/Lectures/10-augmentedTrees/augtrees.pdf">augmented BSTs</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">Disjoint set data structure</a> are all pretty easy to understand and I think they’re all really cool.</p>

<p>There are some data structure topics which were harder to understand but well worth the effort. For example, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs166/lectures/05/Small05.pdf">this set of slides</a> which explains BTrees and 2-3-4 trees.</p>

<p>For more interesting data structures material, my favorite resources are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chapter 12 of Skiena, and other later chapters of Skiena</li>
  <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs166/">CS166</a>, an awesome Stanford class. The slides are awesome and quite readable. I also enjoyed doing some of the problem sets. For further data structures fun, I recommend <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs166/handouts/090%20Final%20Project%20Topics.pdf">the project ideas handout</a> from the class.</li>
  <li>I’m quite proud of the work I did <a href="http://shlegeris.com/2016/06/16/kth-richest.html">here</a> on a particular data structure problem which isn’t actually that hard but was fun as an amateur activity. My solution to that problem involves several ideas from advanced data structures and I think it’s quite neat.</li>
</ul>
