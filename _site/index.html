<div class="lead">
<p>I am a software engineer from Australia. I have lived in San Francisco for most of the last three years. I'm interested in data structures and effective altruism.</p>
<p>Here are some things that I've written recently:</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/27/wages.html"> Contradictory claims in labor economics</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-27T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 27, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>Here are two claims you could make about the market for unskilled labor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increasing the minimum wage won’t decrease employment among unskilled workers.</li>
  <li>Unskilled immigrants don’t reduce wages for unskilled natives.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently saw someone point out that these can’t both be true, because they imply opposite things about the shape of the demand curve. (I don’t remember where I read this. After writing this post, I found <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/05/infinite_contra.html">this very similar article</a> by Bryan Caplan from 2005; possibly this whole post is just rehashing that post of his after I forgot the source.)</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram of a world where the first claim is true:</p>

<p><img src="/img/min_wage.png" alt="supply and demand diagram" /></p>

<p>So the minumum wage used to be P1, then it got increased to P2. This slightly decreased the number of jobs (from Q1 to Q2), but not by very much.</p>

<p>This means that the demand curve for low-wage employment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand">inelastic</a>.</p>

<p>What would things look like if the second claim were true–that unskilled immigrants don’t reduce wages for unskilled natives?</p>

<p><img src="/img/immigrant_wage.png" alt="supply and demand diagram" /></p>

<p>In this situation, we had a bunch of immigration, and this increased the quantity of low-skilled labor available from Q1 to Q2. (This could be represented as a shift in the supply curve, but representing it as just a shift in quantity works fine for our purposes.) This resulted in only a small decrease in wages, from P1 to P2.</p>

<p>If this is true, then the demand curve is highly elastic!</p>

<p>So these claims, interpreted naively, are contradictory.</p>

<hr />

<p>I understand this now that someone has pointed it out, but I definitely didn’t think of it on my own. I want to notice this kind of thing automatically, just like I automatically notice the discrepancy when someone tells me that an investment is unusually high-return and also low-risk.</p>

<p>I think the best way for me to get good at this to mentally translate all claims about elasticity into “inelastic” or “elastic” every time I hear them. If I can tag claims by their implied elasticities, then I might be better at noticing this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I think the reason that I didn’t notice this is that one of the claims involves an increase in price, and the other involves an increase in quantity. So here is an enumeration of all the different things that it means for demand to be <strong>inelastic</strong>, like it was in the minimum wage case above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If price increases, quantity decreases a bit.</li>
  <li>If price decreases, quantity increases a bit.</li>
  <li>If quantity increases, price decreases a lot.</li>
  <li>If quantity decreases, price increases a lot.</li>
</ul>

<p>And if demand is <strong>elastic</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If price increases, quantity decreases a lot.</li>
  <li>If price decreases, quantity increases a lot.</li>
  <li>If quantity increases, price decreases a bit.</li>
  <li>If quantity decreases, price increases a bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the two graphs, for reference:</p>

<p><img src="/img/both_elasticities.png" alt="supply and demand diagram" /></p>

<p>I should probably make flashcards or something.</p>

<p>Incidentally, what’s the actual truth about the elasticity of low-skilled labor? Bryan Caplan <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/03/the_vice_of_sel.html">argues convincingly</a> that despite the famous high quality study which found that minimum wage increases didn’t cause significant unemployment in one labor market, we should probably just disbelieve that evidence. He gives more arguments <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/05/infinite_contra.html">here</a>. There’s also an effect where new immigrants increase the demand for labor of unskilled workers, but we should probably a priori expect that effect to be small–as Bryan says <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/03/immigration_the_1.html">here</a>, “Low-skill workers only spend a tiny fraction of their income on goods produced by other low-skill workers.  The same goes for every other narrow category of worker.”</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/24/cato.html"> A mistake in the Cato institute report on risks from refugees</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-24T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 24, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I was reading a <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/20/12986886/donald-trump-jr-terrorist-skittles-wrong">Vox article</a> about the risks of Americans being killed by terrorists refugees. It linked to <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf">“Terrorism and Immigration”</a>, a report by the Cato Institute.</p>

<p>Here’s a graph from that report:</p>

<p><img src="/img/cato_graph.png" alt="Graph of murder rates over time" /></p>

<p>This purports to show the US murder rate over time, both including and excluding deaths from foreign-born terrorism. Unsurprisingly, foreign-born terrorism had a measurable impact in 2001 and in no other years.</p>

<p>But something else caught my eye about this graph–the downward jump in 2001 in murder excluding foreign-born terrorism. The jump is abrupt and lasts one year and almost exactly cancels out the effect of the 9/11 attacks. According to the legend of the graph, the murder rate excluding foreign-born terrorism comes from author calculation.</p>

<p>What happened here? Maybe Americans decided to kill each other a lot less after 9/11, in a short-lived burst of patriotism? Maybe they got scared of flying and <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/flying-and-driving-after-the-september-11-attacks">drove their cars more</a>, which consumed enough of their free time that they were too busy to go on their usual murderous rampages?</p>

<p>Or maybe the author totally fucked up and subtracted the 9/11 casualties from a statistical source which wasn’t including terrorism deaths in the first place, and then didn’t notice the obviously weird blip in their resulting data! Anyone want to take bets on which it was?</p>

<p>Well, the author says they got their crime data from <a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm">Disaster Center</a>. Disaster Center gets their data from the FBI’s UCS Annual Crime Reports. According to <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2001/01sec5.pdf">Section 5 of the 2001 UCS report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The statistics of September 11 are not a part of the traditional Crime in the United States publication because they are different from the day-to-day crimes committed in this country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh dear!</p>

<p>I emailed the author of the report, <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/alex-nowrasteh">Alex Nowrasteh</a>; he agrees that this is a mistake.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/05/holden.html"> Objecting to Holden Karnosfky's objections to EA</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-05T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 5, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>Holden Karnofsky published a great post yesterday, called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKZNRSLm7zubKZmfA7vsXvkIofprQLGUoW43CYXPRrk/edit">Some Key Ways in Which I’ve Changed My Mind Over the Last Several Years</a>. Among other things, he wrote that he’s less skeptical of EA than he used to be. He noted that he still has some “concerns and objections” to EA though, and linked to <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/pf/why_the_open_philanthropy_project_isnt_currently/5ie">this comment of his</a> as an example.</p>

<p>I disagree with the objections he made in that comment.</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m generally uncomfortable with (and disagree with) the “obligation” frame of EA. I’m particularly uncomfortable with messages along the lines of “The arts are a waste when there are people suffering,” “You should feel bad about (or feel the need to defend) every dollar you spend on yourself beyond necessities,” etc. I think messages along these lines make EA sound overly demanding/costly to affiliate with as well as intellectually misguided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this message is particularly widespread in EA. I hear people disagreeing with it more than I hear them agreeing with it (eg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/julia.galef/posts/10102614039440802">Julia Galef</a> and <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/31/the-thorny-issue-of-effective-altruism-and-art/">Ozy</a>, just this week). I don’t think any of the EAs I know think “You should feel bad about (or feel the need to defend) every dollar you spend on yourself beyond necessities” (though I guess they might not admit that they think that, even if they do).</p>

<p>The 2015 EA survey described <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/zw/the_2015_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/7x6">the median EA donation of $333</a> as “Certainly good, but not as impressive [as the mean donation]”. That doesn’t sound like a community where they shame people for every dollar not spent on necessities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think there are a variety of messages associated with EA that communicate unwarranted confidence on a variety of dimensions, implying that we know more than we do about what the best causes are and to what extent EAs are “outperforming” the rest of the world in terms of accomplishing good. “Effective altruism could be the last social movement we ever need” and “Global poverty is a rounding error compared to other causes” are both examples of this; both messages have been prominently enough expressed to get in <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai">this article</a>, and both messages are problematic in my view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t buy “both messages have been prominently enough expressed to get in this article”. Journalists specifically look out for problematic things to quote; you should implicitly prepend every quote you see with “After spending a while looking for things that make [whatever group] look bad, the worst I could find was …”.</p>

<p>(The “EA could be the last social movement we ever need” thing was pretty cringeworthy. But that’s by far the cringiest instance of that opinion I’ve ever heard expressed, either privately or publicly.)</p>

<p>I also have criticisms about EAs being overconfident and acting as if they know way more than they do about a wide variety of things, but my criticisms are very different from that. For example, I’m super unimpressed that so many EAs didn’t know that GiveWell thinks that deworming has a <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/">relatively low probability of very high impact</a>. I’m also unimpressed by how many people are incredibly confident that animals aren’t morally relevant despite knowing very little about the topic.</p>

<p>And some EAs (especially rationalists) have this awful habit of proposing incredibly dumb solutions to problems that imply that they think that everyone else in the world is incompetent and that it’s easy to just plow past political problems with shitty amateur subterfuge. Eg yesterday I saw someone proposing that we establish a lab and just unilaterally try to eradicate malarial mosquitos, and I see people propose doing geoengineering without consent of any governments, both of which are terrible ideas.</p>

<p>But that’s pretty different from the complaints that Dylan Matthews was making and that Holden is endorsing.</p>

      <p>I made a tool for visualizing the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient of a population. You can see it <a href="http://shlegeris.com/gini">here</a>. (The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality in a distribution; it’s the most way of quantifying income inequality)</p>

<p>Playing with it has significantly improved my intuitions about how much inequality different Gini coefficients really correspond to.</p>

<p>If you don’t currently know the Gini coefficient of US incomes, then I think it might be an interesting experience to use this tool to try to guess it. Try to type in your best guess as to the US income distribution and see if you overestimated or underestimated the amount of inequality.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/03/tax-percentiles.html"> Should we encourage price discrimination based on income?</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-03T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 3, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>Here’s a crazy half-baked economics idea:</p>

<p>As a society, we could make it easier to discriminate prices based on income. We could set up a system where it’s easy for businesses to have pricing schemes like “This coffee costs $3 for people with income $20k or less, and costs $6 for people with income $130k or higher, and we linearly interpolate between those two prices for people whose incomes are somewhere in the middle.” This could be implemented with credit cards which automatically pay in this way, such that the person selling the coffee doesn’t see your income.</p>

<p>To clarify, I’m not suggesting that the government should <em>force</em> anyone to use this, and I’m not suggesting that they even encourage it. I’m just proposing that the IRS should set up a system to <em>allow</em> companies to do price discrimination in this way.</p>

<p>What effect would this have?</p>

<p>I think it’s likely that willingness to pay for coffee correlates with income. So I suspect that even though they don’t have to, coffee shops would start to use this kind of pricing scheme. This would result in lower prices for poor people, higher prices for rich people, and higher profits for coffee shops. This would probably also increase the number of coffee shops, because the increased profits would mean that the fixed cost of a coffee shop was going to be justified more places.</p>

<p>I don’t think rich people could do anything about this, any more than we can do anything about other price discrimination schemes. The only reason this currently isn’t a thing is that there are high transaction costs on it.</p>

<p>This would obviously end up transferring money from rich people to poor people. The exciting and dangerous feature of this is that after this system was established, no-one controls the level of redistribution.</p>

<p>One other feature/bug of this system is that it would probably make it easier to infer people’s incomes. This would be a big change but I don’t see any reasons that you couldn’t have a society where people mostly know how much money everyone else is making.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Some counterarguments:</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t some companies not adopt this, and then rich people would prefer those companies?”</p>

<p>I don’t think so. Suppose other companies are doing this, and you decide to try and compete by not adopting this. What price level should you set? Well, poor people obviously aren’t going to be buying from you, so they’re right out. So the profit maximizing price is going to be higher than it otherwise be. So the rich people still have to pay more.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t this just result in increased prices for the rich and not decreased prices for the poor?”</p>

<p>I suspect prices would drop a <em>lot</em> for poor people on items where there’s low marginal cost and high fixed cost, eg coffee shops or software or music. Many goods and services have high fixed cost and low marginal cost; those goods would have discriminatory pricing models.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>This is a fun example of a redistributive policy which theoretically doesn’t require a government to do anything except enforce contracts. I think it’s legal to ask people to sign a contract where they state their taxable income for the previous year and promise they’re telling the truth. So a company could set this up without any government intervention at all.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/03/printers.html"> Printers and price discrimination</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-03T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 3, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I’m reading “Modern Principles of Economics” by Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen. I’m really enjoying it—it’s engagingly written and even though I’ve learned most of the material before, I keep learning fun little things.</p>

<p>Here’s my favorite tidbit so far. Printer companies usually sell printers relatively cheaply and set high prices on toner. Similarly, game consoles are usually sold cheaply, with the cost recouped by sales of games. Why is this? (Note that in both cases, the goods are “tied”: there’s competition between Xbox and Playstation on both console prices and game prices, but Xbox games can only be played on Xbox—-Microsoft and Sony aren’t competing on price for games on the other’s console.)</p>

<p>There are a bunch of reasons which are probably true to some extent but aren’t as interesting, so I’ll quickly mention them. Maybe customers are fooled by the low printer price and then get suckered into paying more for the toner. (But often companies buy printers and you’d expect them to take both prices into consideration. And there’s competition between printer companies, so maybe customers should be able to learn to buy the printers with cheaper toner after enough trips to the printer shop where they see cheaper options on the different toner brand.) Or maybe consumers have higher time discounting than companies, so this is effectively a small loan from the company to the consumer.</p>

<p>I’m interested in an explanation which isn’t about that kind of factor. You should think about this yourself, because I think it’s really fun!</p>

<p>Here’s a hint:</p>

<p>It’s about price discrimination. Printer companies would love to charge higher prices to people who want their services more, and charge lower prices to people who want their services less.</p>

<p>And here’s the answer:</p>

<p>People vary in how much they want printers. One way of guessing how much value someone derives from a a printer is seeing how many pages they print. So people who print more probably derive much more value from a printer than people who don’t print very much. Setting a high price on toner and a low price on printers lets you effectively price discriminate so that people who get more value from your product pay you more for it.</p>

<p>Isn’t that neat! It’s obvious once you think about it but I’d never thought about it before.</p>

<p>Kelsey <a href="http://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/149677505536/blacksentai-white-dudes-have-this-thing-whereg">recently wrote</a> about this Tumblr post:</p>

<script async="" src="https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/post.js"></script>

<p>I interpret this somewhat differently than she does.</p>

<p>I think the author is making two closely related but distinct claims.</p>

<p>The first claim is that when you’re privileged, many fewer discussions are viscerally upsetting, and you might not realize that other people might get really upset about things you’re discussing lightly. So we should bear this in mind when we’re talking about potentially upsetting topics, and we shouldn’t look down on people for being unwilling or unable to discuss these comfortably.</p>

<p>There’s a whole host of reasons why I agree with this. In some cases, people are justifiably afraid of imminent violence from people with particular prejudices, and want to avoid people who have a particular opinion. In a lot of other cases, particular conversations make them feel really uncomfortable. A software engineer friend of mine said that people who think women are worse at programming just tend to be extremely unpleasant company for her, and she’s never met one who had enough positive qualities to override that negative one. And, like, just in general I think people should be allowed to opt out of conversations they don’t want to have, unless there’s a good reason to expect them to have the conversation.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I think the post kind of makes a second claim, though, which is that it’s not actually admirable or desirable for people to be able to talk to someone who disagrees with them on issues that the two of them care a lot about. And this one I strongly disagree with.</p>

<p>Here’s why I think it’s good to be able to talk dispassionately about things which matter a lot to you. To start with, I think that moral progress occurs more quickly when people who disagree can talk to each other and learn why they disagree. I think a good example is made by the OP writing about people who think that they “don’t deserve health care”. I suspect that the OP is talking about disagreements over how to fund healthcare. I think that’s an extremely inaccurate and unfair summary of the position that the OP’s talking about.[1]</p>

<p>I totally believe that when someone says they don’t think America can afford a single-payer solution, the OP hears that as the person saying that they don’t deserve healthcare. And again, the OP doesn’t have an obligation to talk to people who stress them out. And it’s probably harder not to get stressed out by these conversations when you feel more threatened in your daily life, because of poverty or whatever other reason. But the end result is that to make life easier for themselves, the OP has sacrificed their ability to change their mind or change anyone else’s mind on this. That’s a cost that might be worth paying, but it’s worth remembering that it’s definitely a cost.</p>

<p>(Just in general, I think it’s worth erring on the side of trying to convince people of facts rather than values. A few quick reasons I believe this: Fact-spreading is more co-operative. In political discourse, a lot of things can either be viewed as factual disagreements or value disagreements, and I think that trying to think of them as factual disagreements is a useful exercise for increasing your politeness and persuasiveness. And if you spend a while learning about facts to argue with someone, I think you’re possibly more likely to have learned something useful than if you spent that time trying to write emotional appeals to convince third parties that the person you’re arguing against has an abhorrent belief.)</p>

<p>I think this kind of attitude elevates intolerance of political beliefs to a virtue. Posts like this one tell the OP’s friends that their political enemies are monsters who literally believe that “native children should be ripped away from their cultures and people”. This post tells the OP’s enemies that the OP has no idea about why people disagree with them, and it makes the OP’s enemies quite reasonably less enthusiastic about taking the OP seriously in future. Social groups naturally have an evolutionary pressure to make themselves more insular, and hating outsiders is the kind of thing that they’re always going to be drifting towards; I want to oppose that trend, not encourage it.</p>

<p>So I think there are two very different claims the post is making. I think the reason that the post doesn’t distinguish between them is that they can be phrased very similarly: “it’s unreasonable to expect oppressed people to be able to dispassionately discuss political disagreements which personally affect them” is a sentence which could be taken to mean either claim.</p>

<p>In general, it’s always a subtle and difficult point to say that X is non-optimal but also we shouldn’t force people to not do X if they really want to. I wish English were better at expressing this.</p>

<p>[1] I’m not actually totally sure about this. I think that if you examined people’s System 1 beliefs about, for example, public health care for poor black people, you’d find that a good proportion of them are actually thinking of some “welfare queen” stereotype. I think it’s worth not describing this kind of disagreement as a value disagreement, though. If you asked the person to explain their belief, they’d probably end up revealing some empirically false belief they have about what it’s like to be poor and black.</p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I read a chapter of The Armchair Economist today. It’s an engagingly written book.</p>

<p>Here’s one passage I found particularly interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now let me return to that dollar bill whisked away by the New Orleans wind. I knew that if I let that dollar get away, it would land in a place where it would never be found—it would be as good as burned. What were my options?</p>

  <p>Option One is to kiss the dollar good-bye. The cost-benefit accounting: I lose a dollar, the rest of the world gains a dollar through falling prices, and the world as a whole is neither richer nor poorer than before. The consequence for economic efficiency: None.</p>

  <p>Option Two is to grab the dollar, exerting approximately three cents’ worth of effort. (That is, three cents is about what I would have been willing to pay my friend David to retrieve the dollar for me instead of grabbing it myself.) The cost-benefit accounting: I lose three cents, the rest of the world neither gains nor loses, and the world as a whole (including me) is three cents poorer. The consequence for economic efficiency: A decline. By a purely selfish accounting, losing the dollar is costlier than grabbing it. But if I let the dollar go, my losses are offset by others’ gains. If I grab it, my (substantially smaller) losses are not offset by anything. The logic of efficiency compels me to let it go.</p>

  <p>Or does it? Let me distinguish between two quite different propositions. One is that economic efficiency should be an important consideration in resolving issues of public policy. The other is that economic efficiency should be an important consideration in resolving issues of personal conduct. It is only the first of these propositions that economists frequently defend. Like most people, economists are vocal when they criticize governments but coy when they criticize each other.</p>

  <p>The efficiency criterion treats everybody equally. A cost is a cost, no matter who bears it. In the realm of public policy, this is an appealing feature. But in our private affairs, it seems odd to insist that we should behave as if our own concerns carry no more weight than those of distant strangers. There are times–as on that day in New Orleans–when I think that efficiency fails entirely as a guide to how I should behave. But there are other times when it serves me pretty well. When my lawn gets shaggier than the neighbors would prefer, I have to ask myself whether I am morally obliged to take action. In the process, I think about what it would cost me to get the lawn mowed, and how unhappy I think the neighbors really are. If it seems likely to cost me $30 worth of effort to save the neighbors from $20 worth of grief, I pour myself a lemonade and stop worrying. If I believe that with $30 worth of effort I could save the neighbors from $50 worth of grief, then I feel like a jerk until I mow the lawn.</p>

  <p>That’s an efficiency calculation, and it leads me to conclusions that feel right. I’m not entirely consistent about this. When I decide whether to operate an internal combustion engine or an aerosol can, I do care about the harm that I might do to others by damaging the air quality. I emphatically do not care about the psychic harm that I might do to others who are morally offended by the very idea of my operating an internal combustion engine or an aerosol can. I think that this distinction would be very hard to justify philosophically. If my driving makes you unhappy, then I have made the world a less happy place in a way that is independent of why my driving makes you unhappy. The strict logic of efficiency would say that if I am prepared to stay home rather than cause $10 worth of damage to your lungs, then I should also be prepared to stay home rather than cause $10 worth of damage to your moral sensibilities.</p>

  <p>I infer that although my moral philosophy is incomplete, efficiency considerations play a major role. But my last trip to Boston shook my faith a bit.</p>

  <p>I flew from Denver, with my wife, and our round-trip tickets totaled just under $2,500.I offered alternatives to the publisher who was footing the bill, but he insisted that we come anyway. Still, I’m sure that if I’d been paying my own way I would have canceled the trip.</p>

  <p>This led me to formulate the following moral dilemma: Suppose that getting to Boston and back is worth $300 to you. It costs the airline $200 to provide that transportation. But because of some extraordinary degree of monopoly power, the airline charges $1,000 for the ticket. Should you fly? If you care only about efficiency, then you certainly should. If you fly, you are worse off by $700 (the difference between what you pay and the value of the trip), while the owners of the airline are better off by $800 (the difference between what they collect and the cost of flying you). There is a net gain of $100 and the efficiency criterion pronounces the trip a Good Thing.</p>

  <p>Yet I am sure that I would not buy the ticket and I am equally sure that I would lose no sleep over it. I am sure that I would reach the same conclusion no matter how much the airline owners stood to gain, or how little I stood to lose. So while I still believe that efficiency is usually the right general guide to government policy, and often the right general guide to personal behavior, I now think that we need a much subtler criterion before we can really know what it means to be good. I believe that there are times when I ought try to behave efficiently and other times when I need not. I just haven’t figured out the rules for knowing which times are which.</p>

  <p>I did retrieve that dollar, without a moment’s concern for its effect on the general price level. I feel no guilt, though I’m not sure why.</p>
