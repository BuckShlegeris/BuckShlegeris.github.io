    <h2><a href="/2016/10/29/bundling.html"> A geometric description of when to bundle goods</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-29T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 29, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I recently interviewed Chen-Yu Yang at work, and after the interview he scored basically the maximum possible number of unofficial bonus points by looking at my website and emailing me most of the answer to a question I posed here a while ago.</p>

<p>My question was, suppose you have a bunch of goods and you want to maximize profit by bundling the goods. (Bundling is the super neat thing where you can increase your profit by selling two products together instead of separately. See the description <a href="http://market.subwiki.org/wiki/Price_bundling">here</a> if you haven’t heard of it before.) How do you efficiently figure out the optimal bundling strategy?</p>

<p>Chen-Yu’s insight was that you can interpret bundling as a geometric question. I’m going to explain his insight here, and present the proof that there is no fast algorithm for bundling in a later post. I think this geometric description of bundling is extremely valuable–when I was learning about bundling, I desperately wished that there was a graph somewhere that would have shown me how to picture in my head whether bundling made sense in a given situation. So here goes:</p>

<p>Suppose you have two people, let’s call them Buck and Chen-Yu, who have different maximum prices for goods X and Y. We can plot that on a diagram with the two people on different axes:</p>

<p><img src="/img/bundling/figure_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For product X, you can see that Buck is willing to pay $8 for it but Chen-Yu is willing to pay $24. Because Chen-Yu’s price is more than double Buck’s, profit is maximized by setting the price to $24 and only selling to Chen-Yu.</p>

<p>For good Y, where Buck is willing to pay $31 and Chen-Yu is willing to pay $21, the story is different—the two prices are within a factor of 2, so profit is maximized by selling to both.</p>

<p>I’ve drawn the lines C=2B and B=2C onto the graph, and shaded the region outside them. The shaded regions are where it makes sense to sell to only one person; the white region is where you sell to both.</p>

<p>There’s an interesting pattern to which consumer’s willingness to pay controls the price:</p>

<p><img src="/img/bundling/figure_6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, in the upmost section, only Chen-Yu is buying, and only his willingness to pay affects the sale price. But if Buck’s willingness to pay grows within a factor of 2 of Chen-Yu’s, then the price will be set to Buck’s willingness to pay.</p>

<p>But here’s where it gets really cool: What about the bundle X + Y? We can draw that onto the graph as well:</p>

<p><img src="/img/bundling/figure_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>and we see that it’s in the white region. Now let’s state a theorem:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem: If and only if the best strategy for X + Y is to sell to both customers (that is, X + Y is in the white region), bundling is the dominant price scheme.</strong></p>

<p>Why? The proof is kind of long, so I’ve put it at the bottom of this post; feel free to read it there.</p>

<p>But this is a really useful explanation of when you want to bundle: only when you want to sell the bundle to both customers!</p>

<h2 id="appendix-proof-of-the-theorem">Appendix: Proof of the theorem</h2>

<p>First let’s prove the <strong>-&gt; direction</strong>–that if X + Y is in the white region, bundling is dominant:</p>

<p>X + Y is in the white region. Let’s assume that Buck’s price is lower than Chen-Yu’s price, so we’re going to be charging Buck’s price to both customers. There is no possible way of getting more money out of Buck, because we are already selling him both goods at his maximum price for each good. What about Chen-Yu? Well, we don’t want to raise the price unless Chen-Yu’s price for the bundle is more than 2x Buck’s price, because otherwise we’ll lose Buck’s business. And if Chen-Yu’s price for the bundle was 2x Buck’s price, then we wouldn’t be in the white region! So Buck’s price really is the profit maximizing price. (If Buck’s price is higher than Chen-Yu’s price, you just do the same proof, but with names reversed.)</p>

<p>Now let’s prove the <strong>other direction</strong>: that if bundling is the dominant price scheme overall, you want to sell your bundle to both parties. This is equivalent to: if you don’t want to sell your bundle to both parties, bundling is not the dominant price scheme. Let’s prove that:</p>

<p>Let’s say that Buck’s bundle price is more than double Chen-Yu’s bundle price, so you only want to sell to Buck. Buck values at least one of X or Y more than twice as highly than Chen-Yu does; let’s say it’s X. So if we weren’t bundling, that good should just be sold to Buck.</p>

<p>What price should good Y be sold at? Either Buck’s price or Chen-Yu’s price. Let’s say it’s Buck’s price. Then it doesn’t matter if we bundle or not, because in both cases only Buck will buy both goods, so the price is just his willingness to pay. What about if it’s Chen-Yu’s price? In that case, you just want to sell it to Chen-Yu and not to Buck, so bundling will actively make your price scheme worse. (If Chen-Yu’s price were high enough that it made sense to bundle, then given bundling, we’d want to sell to both people.)</p>

<p>QED.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/10/23/poor-college-graduates.html"> Poor college graduates do much better than rich high-school dropouts</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-23T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 23, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/18/poor-kids-who-do-everything-right-dont-do-better-than-rich-kids-who-do-everything-wrong/">This article from 2014</a>, with the provocative title “Poor kids who do everything right don’t do better than rich kids who do everything wrong” is terrible. It makes a shitty and misleading graph, and makes a variety of nonsensical judgements based on it.</p>

<p>The graph used makes it really hard to see what the actual distributions of overall income are. If you make, say, a bar graph of the income distributions, you’ll see that poor college grads do much better than rich high school dropouts. I made such a graph (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/112K9ejdFQMPcnvEqERT2k2Oe7Tk7zJ-YHFuA3LikFRA/edit?usp=sharing">here’s the spreadsheet</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/img/poor-college-grads.png" alt="Bar chart" /></p>

<p>I also estimated the average incomes of both groups based on the given statistics, and found an average income of $78k for the poor college grads and $60k for the rich high school dropouts.</p>

<p>The main piece of evidence that this blog post uses to support its thesis is: “Specifically, rich high school dropouts remain in the top about as much as poor college grads stay stuck in the bottom — 14 versus 16 percent, respectively. Not only that, but these low-income strivers are just as likely to end up in the bottom as these wealthy ne’er-do-wells. Some meritocracy.”</p>

<p>The first of these statistics is not clearly related to meritocracy. If you want high income mobility, you want both these numbers to be low. The sentence is phrased as if it’s bad that the numbers are similar; that doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>The second of these statistics is correctly interpreted, but seems cherry-picked: I could just as easily point out that 41% of poor college grads end up in the top 40% of income, while only 19% of rich high school dropouts do. To prevent such cherry-picking, we should probably use the Schelling point summary statistics like mean income or median income, both of which indicate that the poor college grads are doing <em>significantly</em> better.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the original paper didn’t do anything wrong, this “reporter” just decided to make up some bullshit conclusions from the statistics. This is even worse than most reporting–the mistake isn’t something you have to read the original source to find, the mistake is right there in the graph that Facebook is suggesting as the image preview. Alas!</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/10/20/libertarians.html"> Left-libertarianism</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-20T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 20, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I know a lot of people who identify as left-libertarians, or bleeding-heart libertarians, or whatever. Scott argued for this position <a href="slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/">here</a>. Gary Johnson has <a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GaryJohnson1-1.jpg">posed wearing a Bleeding Heart Libertarians shirt</a>. A lot of rationalists and EAs seem to think of this as the political position of utilitarians who are aware of the benefits of free markets but also the costs of externalities and inequality.</p>

<p>I don’t think that these people realize how much their values conflict with classic libertarianism. Most importantly, if you’re one of those EA left-libertarians, you should AFAICT probably support way more redistribution than we currently see, and you would probably overall prefer to expand the total share of GDP controlled by the government.</p>

<p>I’m like 70% sure that from a utilitarian perspective which is just optimizing for the short-term welfare of humans and not particularly other animals or the far future, you want to increase redistribution. This guess is based on looking at the US federal budget and noting that a lot of the money goes to direct transfers or various public services. If you kill all of the government spending libertarians don’t like and then increase redistribution as much as utilitarians would probably want to, I suspect that government spending would get bigger overall. This isn’t even including the possibility of redistribution to other countries–if we’re allowed to do that, I think that government would be way bigger than it is now.</p>

<p>Most libertarians would definitely not be cool with this. Given this redistribution preference, it’s not clear to me that the utilitarian left-libertarian position is closer to the Libertarian party than the Democrat party.</p>

<p>This all assumes that I’m right that we should have more income redistribution. But even if we should only have current levels of redistribution, libertarians probably aren’t on board with a future with tax rates as high as they currently are.</p>

<p>Why do EA left-libertarians identify so closely with libertarians? I think it’s a few things—they haven’t thought about the extent of optimal redistribution, they find libertarianism aesthetically appealing and less ideologically grating than leftism or conservatism. There are also some topics where many libertarians and utilitarians get along pretty well–most of the support for the Open Borders movement seems to come from libertarians. But I think it’s more based on aesthetic preferences than actual policy alignment.</p>
