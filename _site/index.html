    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/18/poor-kids-who-do-everything-right-dont-do-better-than-rich-kids-who-do-everything-wrong/">This article from 2014</a>, with the provocative title “Poor kids who do everything right don’t do better than rich kids who do everything wrong” is terrible. It makes a shitty and misleading graph, and makes a variety of nonsensical judgements based on it.</p>

<p>The graph used makes it really hard to see what the actual distributions of overall income are. If you make, say, a bar graph of the income distributions, you’ll see that poor college grads do much better than rich high school dropouts. I made such a graph (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/112K9ejdFQMPcnvEqERT2k2Oe7Tk7zJ-YHFuA3LikFRA/edit?usp=sharing">here’s the spreadsheet</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/img/poor-college-grads.png" alt="Bar chart" /></p>

<p>I also estimated the average incomes of both groups based on the given statistics, and found an average income of $78k for the poor college grads and $60k for the rich high school dropouts.</p>

<p>The main piece of evidence that this blog post uses to support its thesis is: “Specifically, rich high school dropouts remain in the top about as much as poor college grads stay stuck in the bottom — 14 versus 16 percent, respectively. Not only that, but these low-income strivers are just as likely to end up in the bottom as these wealthy ne’er-do-wells. Some meritocracy.”</p>

<p>The first of these statistics is not clearly related to meritocracy. If you want high income mobility, you want both these numbers to be low. The sentence is phrased as if it’s bad that the numbers are similar; that doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>The second of these statistics is correctly interpreted, but seems cherry-picked: I could just as easily point out that 41% of poor college grads end up in the top 40% of income, while only 19% of rich high school dropouts do. To prevent such cherry-picking, we should probably use the Schelling point summary statistics like mean income or median income, both of which indicate that the poor college grads are doing <em>significantly</em> better.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the original paper didn’t do anything wrong, this “reporter” just decided to make up some bullshit conclusions from the statistics. This is even worse than most reporting–the mistake isn’t something you have to read the original source to find, the mistake is right there in the graph that Facebook is suggesting as the image preview. Alas!</p>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-20T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 20, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I know a lot of people who identify as left-libertarians, or bleeding-heart libertarians, or whatever. Scott argued for this position <a href="slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/">here</a>. Gary Johnson has <a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GaryJohnson1-1.jpg">posed wearing a Bleeding Heart Libertarians shirt</a>. A lot of rationalists and EAs seem to think of this as the political position of utilitarians who are aware of the benefits of free markets but also the costs of externalities and inequality.</p>

<p>I don’t think that these people realize how much their values conflict with classic libertarianism. Most importantly, if you’re one of those EA left-libertarians, you should AFAICT probably support way more redistribution than we currently see, and you would probably overall prefer to expand the total share of GDP controlled by the government.</p>

<p>I’m like 70% sure that from a utilitarian perspective which is just optimizing for the short-term welfare of humans and not particularly other animals or the far future, you want to increase redistribution. This guess is based on looking at the US federal budget and noting that a lot of the money goes to direct transfers or various public services. If you kill all of the government spending libertarians don’t like and then increase redistribution as much as utilitarians would probably want to, I suspect that government spending would get bigger overall. This isn’t even including the possibility of redistribution to other countries–if we’re allowed to do that, I think that government would be way bigger than it is now.</p>

<p>Most libertarians would definitely not be cool with this. Given this redistribution preference, it’s not clear to me that the utilitarian left-libertarian position is closer to the Libertarian party than the Democrat party.</p>

<p>This all assumes that I’m right that we should have more income redistribution. But even if we should only have current levels of redistribution, libertarians probably aren’t on board with a future with tax rates as high as they currently are.</p>

<p>Why do EA left-libertarians identify so closely with libertarians? I think it’s a few things—they haven’t thought about the extent of optimal redistribution, they find libertarianism aesthetically appealing and less ideologically grating than leftism or conservatism. There are also some topics where many libertarians and utilitarians get along pretty well–most of the support for the Open Borders movement seems to come from libertarians. But I think it’s more based on aesthetic preferences than actual policy alignment.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/10/07/optimal-tax.html"> Optimal redistribution with a flat tax</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-07T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 7, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>Suppose you have a bunch of people differ only in their wage <script type="math/tex">w</script>. Everyone has utility logarithmic in their consumption. As the government, you want to promote welfare by redistributing consumption. You decide to do this by instituting a flat tax and using it to fund a universal basic income.</p>

<p>The more revenue you raise with your tax, the higher the UBI can be. But if you raise the tax too high, you will excessively deter people from working. So what’s the optimal tax rate?</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, Ben Weinstein-Raun and I managed to find an analytical solution to this problem. The optimal flat tax rate is a simple function of the wage distribution:</p>

<p>$^$\text{Optimal flat tax rate} = 1 - \frac{\text{Harmonic mean of wages}}{\text{Arithmetic mean of wages}}$^$</p>

<p>The functional form checks out: Harmonic mean equals arithmetic mean on a set which is perfectly equal; in that case the fraction will be 1 and the tax rate will be 0. Inequality causes the harmonic mean to become smaller than the arithmetic mean; at most, the fraction might go to 0 and the tax rate will approach 100%.</p>

<p>Another way of phrasing that fraction is “the average time it takes for someone to make a dollar, multiplied by the average wage”.</p>

<p>I did most of the algebra in Sympy; almost all of the math I write here is replicated in <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/economics-demos/blob/master/python/optimal_tax.py">this Python script</a>, which I also put online as a Sage workbook <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/0a4323fd-9bc8-4276-a48c-cb0de6ecf3fe/files/2016-10-11-195016.html">here</a>. Because of that, I’m reasonably confident in this result.</p>

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>Let’s define all our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">w</script> is the wage of an individual</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">r</script> is 1 minus the tax rate</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">h</script> is the amount of time that a person works, in some unit. The units don’t affect the optimal tax rate.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">c</script> is the UBI</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">u</script> is utility</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">y</script> is the pre-tax, pre-transfers income of an individual, <script type="math/tex">Y</script> is the income of all of society</li>
  <li>there are <script type="math/tex">n</script> people. The set of people is <script type="math/tex">P</script>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So individuals have utility <script type="math/tex">u = \log(w \cdot h \cdot r + c) - h</script>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-individual-behavior-as-a-function-of-r-and-c">What is individual behavior, as a function of <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">c</script>?</h3>

<p>First we find the optimal hours worked for an individual by differentiating utility with respect to hours worked:</p>

<p>$^$\frac{du}{dh} = \frac{w \cdot r}{w \cdot h \cdot r + c} - 1$^$</p>

<p>Setting the derivative to 0 and solving for <script type="math/tex">h</script>, you get</p>

<p>$^$h = 1 - \frac{c}{r \cdot w} $^$</p>

<p>Let’s check functional form–we expect workers to work more if they have lower UBI, lower taxes, or higher wages. This function has all those behaviors (remember that <script type="math/tex">r</script> is the proportion of your income you get to keep, not the tax rate).</p>

<p>The optimal income is that time multiplied by <script type="math/tex">w</script>, so:</p>

<p>$^$y = w - \frac{c}{r}$^$</p>

<p>Note that this means that everyone forgoes the same amount of income due to the distortionary effects of the UBI and taxes.</p>

<p>At this income, utility for an individual is:</p>

<p>$^$u = \log(r) - 1 + \log(w) + \frac{c}{r\cdot w}$^$</p>

<p>And utility over all of society is therefore:</p>

<p>$^$U = n\cdot\log(r) - n + \sum_{p \in P}\log(w_p) + \frac{c}{r\cdot w_p}$^$</p>

<p>We can rewrite this to</p>

<p>$^$U = n\cdot\log(r) - n + \sum_{p \in P}\left[\log(w_p)\right] + \frac{c}{r} \cdot \sum_{p \in P} \left[\frac{1}{w_p} \right]$^$</p>

<h4 id="total-societal-income">Total societal income</h4>

<p>Given <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">c</script>, the income of the whole population is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
  Y &= \sum_{p \in P} y_p \\
   &=  \sum_{p \in P} \left(w_p - \frac{c}{r}\right)
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Conveniently, the <script type="math/tex">\frac{c}{r}</script> term is constant in the sum, so we can take it out:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
 Y  &=  - \frac{n \cdot c}{r} + \sum_{p \in P} w_p \\
    &=  -\frac{n \cdot c}{r} + W
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>where the total wage of the whole population is <script type="math/tex">W = \sum_{p \in P} w_p</script>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-c-given-r">What is <script type="math/tex">c</script>, given <script type="math/tex">r</script>?</h3>

<p>At a given tax rate <script type="math/tex">r</script>, the UBI (by definition) is:</p>

<p>$^$c = \frac{1-r}{n} \cdot Y $^$</p>

<p>We can substitute the other expression we found for <script type="math/tex">Y</script> above into this equation:</p>

<p>$^$c = \frac{1-r}{n} \cdot \left( -\frac{n \cdot c}{r} + W \right) $^$</p>

<p>and solve for <script type="math/tex">c</script>, which gets us</p>

<p>$^$c = \frac{-r \cdot W \cdot (r - 1)}n$^$</p>

<p>So given a tax rate, we now know the equilibrium UBI.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-u-given-r">What is <script type="math/tex">U</script>, given <script type="math/tex">r</script>?</h3>

<p>We can now substitute the equilibrium UBI into our global utility formula to determine global utility at this tax rate:</p>

<p>$^$U = n\cdot(\log(r) - 1) + \sum_{p \in P}\left[\log(w_p)\right] - \frac{\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right]\cdot W\cdot(r - 1)}n$^$</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-optimal-choice-of-r">What is the optimal choice of <script type="math/tex">r</script>?</h3>

<p>Now we differentiate <script type="math/tex">U</script> with respect to <script type="math/tex">r</script>:</p>

<p>$^$\frac{dU}{dr} = \frac{-\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right] \cdot W}{n} + \frac{n}{r}$^$</p>

<p>Set this to zero and solve for <script type="math/tex">r</script>, and you get:</p>

<p>$^$\frac{n^2}{\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right] \cdot W}$^$</p>

<p>Remember that <script type="math/tex">W</script> is the sum of wages. So this can be written as</p>

<p>$^$\frac{n^2}{\sum_{p \in P}\left[\frac{1}{w_p}\right] \cdot \sum_{p \in P}\left[w_p\right]}$^$</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208780739570567&amp;set=a.1254922647920.38754.1075180788&amp;type=3">posted on Facebook</a> asking for someone to make sense of this expression for me. Matt Alger and Ben Weinstein-Raun both figured out that it is the harmonic mean of the wages divided by the arithmetic mean of the wages.</p>

<p>So overall:</p>

<p>$^$\text{Optimal flat tax rate} = 1 - \frac{\text{Harmonic mean of wages}}{\text{Arithmetic mean of wages}}$^$</p>

<h2 id="further-questions">Further questions</h2>

<p>I am interested to see if this process could be extended to find optimal tax structures for other situations. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What happens if people have different levels of avarice: that is, some of them get more pleasure from money than others?</li>
  <li>What happens if leisure time has diminishing marginal returns?</li>
  <li>What about if we don’t want to be restricted to a flat tax? Can we solve for the optimal tax function, where a tax function is a function from different pre-tax incomes to post-tax incomes?</li>
</ul>

<p>I should also look harder to see if my result here is already known in the optimal tax literature. My impression is that economists aren’t that interested in this particular question, because they don’t like the rigidity of my assumed utility function. But I still think this result is really neat, and I’m very glad to know it.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/10/02/ubi.html"> Universal basic incomes disincentivise work</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-02T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 2, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p><strong>epistemic status: pedantic point about math which probably isn’t too relevant to most real life questions</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes people say that a universal basic income would be good, because unlike the current welfare system which phases out benefits as your income increases, imposing an effective high marginal tax rate, the UBI stays constant as your income rises. As a result, these people claim, the UBI does not disincentivise work.</p>

<p>This is false. Increasing the UBI means that your <script type="math/tex">n</script>th hour of work has lower utility than it would have had otherwise, because of diminishing marginal returns. So the UBI discourages work.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Just for fun, here’s what the math looks like for this.</p>

<p>Suppose a worker’s utility function is</p>

<p>$^$\text{utility} = \log(\text{wage} \cdot \text{tax rate} \cdot \text{hours worked} + \text{UBI}) - \text{hours worked}$^$</p>

<p>Let the wage be <script type="math/tex">w</script>, tax rate <script type="math/tex">1 - r</script>, hours worked <script type="math/tex">h</script>, UBI <script type="math/tex">c</script>. Assume flat tax for simplicity. So <script type="math/tex">U = \log(w \cdot h \cdot r + c) - h</script>. The optimal amount of work happens when <script type="math/tex">\frac{dU}{dh}</script> is zero.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
  0 &= \frac{dU}{dh} \\
    &= \frac{r \cdot w}{c + h \cdot r \cdot w} - 1 \\
  r \cdot w &= c + h \cdot r \cdot w \\
  r \cdot w - c &= h \cdot r \cdot w \\
  h &= \frac{r \cdot w - c}{r \cdot w}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>So increasing the UBI decreases hours worked, and the effect is stronger if your wage is lower.</p>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-10-02T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct 2, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p><strong>Epistemic status: mostly interesting as a tool to clarify your thinking about how tax rates should be decided. For a variety of practical reasons (especially <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bshlgrs/posts/10208748763091175?comment_id=10208748871013873&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R2%22%7D">these ones</a>), we might want to have low marginal tax rates on the poor.</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you’re trying to effectively tax a bunch of software engineers who are all making around $100k a year.  Your current tax system charges 0% tax between $0k and $50k, then 50% after $50k.</p>

<p>This is very progressive. You consider changing it to the following regressive scheme: Charge 50% tax between $0k and $50k, then 0% after $50k.</p>

<p>Which tax is better, the regressive or the progressive tax?</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>The regressive tax is probably a Pareto improvement. It raises the same amount of revenue, but it’s less distortionary. A 60% marginal tax is going to discourage the engineers from working, and a 0% marginal tax won’t.</p>

<p>The key insight here is that when we’re taxing high-income people, we want to maximize average tax rates (for equitability) and minimize marginal tax rates (for efficiency). Because average tax rates come from the integral of marginal tax rates, you have to weigh between these two goals when you’re choosing tax systems.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>What about if our society is pretty unequal? Let’s say it has two types of people, software engineers and musicians. Engineers make about $100k, musicians make about $40k. What’s the best redistributive system?</p>

<p>It’s going to be a regressive tax with a universal basic income. It turns out that it’s more important to have low marginal tax rates on engineers than musicians. As a utilitarian social planner, it’s much worse to discourage engineers from working than to discourage musicians from working, because if we want to increase the incomes of musicians, we can just give them free money as a UBI. So we want to put all the high marginal tax rates on the musicians, down at a low enough income level so that the engineers won’t be discouraged by them.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I’m not just making this up. Most economists seem to agree with me, including leftists like Emmanuel Saez—he’s a good friend of Piketty and a big supporter of increasing tax rates on the rich. His <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/derive.pdf">famous 2001 paper</a> on deriving optimal marginal tax rates came up with these graphs which show a marginal tax rate of more than 60% for people making minimum wage:</p>

<p><img src="/img/saez_marginal_rates.png" alt="Saez graph of marginal tax rates" /></p>

<p>And the more right-learning economists who wrote <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4263739/Mankiw_OptimalTaxationTheory.pdf?sequence=2">Optimal Taxation in Theory and Practice</a> say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One perhaps counterintuitive result of these kinds of simulations is that they imply that marginal taxes should be higher at low wages than for most of the rest of the distribution. The intuition behind this result is that high marginal rates at low incomes allow for large lump-sum transfers to be given to those of the lowest ability levels without tempting higher-ability workers to work less and claim those transfers. For higher-ability workers, the net value of marginal income is too high at low incomes, so they are deterred from working less despite the generous redistribution offered to those with low ability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So should we increase marginal tax rates on the poor? It turns out we don’t need to. We already have high marginal tax rates on the poor, because most welfare programs phase out their support as incomes increase. In the past, I’ve seen a bunch of people argue that this means-testing is bad, because of the extremely high marginal tax rates it imposes. But now that I’ve been convinced that high marginal tax rates on the poor are good, I’m not as concerned by this anymore.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/27/wages.html"> Contradictory claims in labor economics</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-27T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 27, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>Here are two claims you could make about the market for unskilled labor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increasing the minimum wage won’t decrease employment among unskilled workers.</li>
  <li>Unskilled immigrants don’t reduce wages for unskilled natives.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently saw someone point out that these can’t both be true, because they imply opposite things about the shape of the demand curve. (I don’t remember where I read this. After writing this post, I found <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/05/infinite_contra.html">this very similar article</a> by Bryan Caplan from 2005; possibly this whole post is just rehashing that post of his after I forgot the source.)</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram of a world where the first claim is true:</p>

<p><img src="/img/min_wage.png" alt="supply and demand diagram" /></p>

<p>So the minumum wage used to be P1, then it got increased to P2. This slightly decreased the number of jobs (from Q1 to Q2), but not by very much.</p>

<p>This means that the demand curve for low-wage employment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand">inelastic</a>.</p>

<p>What would things look like if the second claim were true–that unskilled immigrants don’t reduce wages for unskilled natives?</p>

<p><img src="/img/immigrant_wage.png" alt="supply and demand diagram" /></p>

<p>In this situation, we had a bunch of immigration, and this increased the quantity of low-skilled labor available from Q1 to Q2. (This could be represented as a shift in the supply curve, but representing it as just a shift in quantity works fine for our purposes.) This resulted in only a small decrease in wages, from P1 to P2.</p>

<p>If this is true, then the demand curve is highly elastic!</p>

<p>So these claims, interpreted naively, are contradictory.</p>

<p>I understand this now that someone has pointed it out, but I definitely didn’t think of it on my own. I want to notice this kind of thing automatically, just like I automatically notice the discrepancy when someone tells me that an investment is unusually high-return and also low-risk.</p>

<p>I think the best way for me to get good at this to mentally translate all claims about elasticity into “inelastic” or “elastic” every time I hear them. If I can tag claims by their implied elasticities, then I might be better at noticing this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I think the reason that I didn’t notice this is that one of the claims involves an increase in price, and the other involves an increase in quantity. So here is an enumeration of all the different things that it means for demand to be <strong>inelastic</strong>, like it was in the minimum wage case above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If price increases, quantity decreases a bit.</li>
  <li>If price decreases, quantity increases a bit.</li>
  <li>If quantity increases, price decreases a lot.</li>
  <li>If quantity decreases, price increases a lot.</li>
</ul>

<p>And if demand is <strong>elastic</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If price increases, quantity decreases a lot.</li>
  <li>If price decreases, quantity increases a lot.</li>
  <li>If quantity increases, price decreases a bit.</li>
  <li>If quantity decreases, price increases a bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the two graphs, for reference:</p>

<p><img src="/img/both_elasticities.png" alt="supply and demand diagram" /></p>

<p>I should probably make flashcards or something.</p>

<p>Incidentally, what’s the actual truth about the elasticity of low-skilled labor? Bryan Caplan <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/03/the_vice_of_sel.html">argues convincingly</a> that despite the famous high quality study which found that minimum wage increases didn’t cause significant unemployment in one labor market, we should probably just disbelieve that evidence. He gives more arguments <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/05/infinite_contra.html">here</a>. There’s also an effect where new immigrants increase the demand for labor of unskilled workers, but we should probably a priori expect that effect to be small–as Bryan says <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/03/immigration_the_1.html">here</a>, “Low-skill workers only spend a tiny fraction of their income on goods produced by other low-skill workers.  The same goes for every other narrow category of worker.”</p>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-24T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 24, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p>I was reading a <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/20/12986886/donald-trump-jr-terrorist-skittles-wrong">Vox article</a> about the risks of Americans being killed by terrorists refugees. It linked to <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf">“Terrorism and Immigration”</a>, a report by the Cato Institute.</p>

<p>Here’s a graph from that report:</p>

<p><img src="/img/cato_graph.png" alt="Graph of murder rates over time" /></p>

<p>This purports to show the US murder rate over time, both including and excluding deaths from foreign-born terrorism. Unsurprisingly, foreign-born terrorism had a measurable impact in 2001 and in no other years.</p>

<p>But something else caught my eye about this graph–the downward jump in 2001 in murder excluding foreign-born terrorism. The jump is abrupt and lasts one year and almost exactly cancels out the effect of the 9/11 attacks. According to the legend of the graph, the murder rate excluding foreign-born terrorism comes from author calculation.</p>

<p>What happened here? Maybe Americans decided to kill each other a lot less after 9/11, in a short-lived burst of patriotism? Maybe they got scared of flying and <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/flying-and-driving-after-the-september-11-attacks">drove their cars more</a>, which consumed enough of their free time that they were too busy to go on their usual murderous rampages?</p>

<p>Or maybe the author totally fucked up and subtracted the 9/11 casualties from a statistical source which wasn’t including terrorism deaths in the first place, and then didn’t notice the obviously weird blip in their resulting data! Anyone want to take bets on which it was?</p>

<p>Well, the author says they got their crime data from <a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm">Disaster Center</a>. Disaster Center gets their data from the FBI’s UCS Annual Crime Reports. According to <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2001/01sec5.pdf">Section 5 of the 2001 UCS report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The statistics of September 11 are not a part of the traditional Crime in the United States publication because they are different from the day-to-day crimes committed in this country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh dear!</p>

<p>I emailed the author of the report, <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/alex-nowrasteh">Alex Nowrasteh</a>; he agrees that this is a mistake.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/09/05/holden.html"> Objecting to Holden Karnosfky's objections to EA</a></h2>

    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2016-09-05T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sep 5, 2016</time></p>

    <div class="shrink-headings">
      <p><strong>epistemic status: uncertain</strong></p>

<p>Holden Karnofsky published a great post yesterday, called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKZNRSLm7zubKZmfA7vsXvkIofprQLGUoW43CYXPRrk/edit">Some Key Ways in Which I’ve Changed My Mind Over the Last Several Years</a>. Among other things, he wrote that he’s less skeptical of EA than he used to be. He noted that he still has some “concerns and objections” to EA though, and linked to <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/pf/why_the_open_philanthropy_project_isnt_currently/5ie">this comment of his</a> as an example.</p>

<p>I disagree with the objections he made in that comment.</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m generally uncomfortable with (and disagree with) the “obligation” frame of EA. I’m particularly uncomfortable with messages along the lines of “The arts are a waste when there are people suffering,” “You should feel bad about (or feel the need to defend) every dollar you spend on yourself beyond necessities,” etc. I think messages along these lines make EA sound overly demanding/costly to affiliate with as well as intellectually misguided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this message is particularly widespread in EA. I hear people disagreeing with it more than I hear them agreeing with it (eg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/julia.galef/posts/10102614039440802">Julia Galef</a> and <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/31/the-thorny-issue-of-effective-altruism-and-art/">Ozy</a>, just this week). I don’t think any of the EAs I know think “You should feel bad about (or feel the need to defend) every dollar you spend on yourself beyond necessities” (though I guess they might not admit that they think that, even if they do).</p>

<p>The 2015 EA survey described <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/zw/the_2015_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/7x6">the median EA donation of $333</a> as “Certainly good, but not as impressive [as the mean donation]”. That doesn’t sound like a community where they shame people for every dollar not spent on necessities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think there are a variety of messages associated with EA that communicate unwarranted confidence on a variety of dimensions, implying that we know more than we do about what the best causes are and to what extent EAs are “outperforming” the rest of the world in terms of accomplishing good. “Effective altruism could be the last social movement we ever need” and “Global poverty is a rounding error compared to other causes” are both examples of this; both messages have been prominently enough expressed to get in <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai">this article</a>, and both messages are problematic in my view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t buy “both messages have been prominently enough expressed to get in this article”. Journalists specifically look out for problematic things to quote; you should implicitly prepend every quote you see with “After spending a while looking for things that make [whatever group] look bad, the worst I could find was …”.</p>

<p>(The “EA could be the last social movement we ever need” thing was pretty cringeworthy. But that’s by far the cringiest instance of that opinion I’ve ever heard expressed, either privately or publicly.)</p>

<p>I also have criticisms about EAs being overconfident and acting as if they know way more than they do about a wide variety of things, but my criticisms are very different from that. For example, I’m super unimpressed that so many EAs didn’t know that GiveWell thinks that deworming has a <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/">relatively low probability of very high impact</a>. I’m also unimpressed by how many people are incredibly confident that animals aren’t morally relevant despite knowing very little about the topic.</p>

<p>And some EAs (especially rationalists) have this awful habit of proposing incredibly dumb solutions to problems that imply that they think that everyone else in the world is incompetent and that it’s easy to just plow past political problems with shitty amateur subterfuge. Eg yesterday I saw someone proposing that we establish a lab and just unilaterally try to eradicate malarial mosquitos, and I see people propose doing geoengineering without consent of any governments, both of which are terrible ideas.</p>

<p>But that’s pretty different from the complaints that Dylan Matthews was making and that Holden is endorsing.</p>
