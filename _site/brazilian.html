Oh, my conscience is eating me slowly
Tearing me up and I'm only
Here for a couple more days
Oh, my darling I'm so inconsistent
So close to making the distance
Now I can't look in your face
Now I can't look in your face
Now I can't look in your face

Hey! You know there's a Brazilian in my bed
Before we kissed, she asked about you
Whether our relationship was dead
And if cheating was really what I wanted to do

And I told the Brazilian girl
That you live so far away now
And we'll break up any day now
I don't want to hurt you
But you can't be hurt by what you don't know
And I'm a river my darling, and I've got to flow
And at the end of semester
She'll head home to Brazil.


Remember when you woke me up crying and you said
In a dream, you found someone in my bed
You found yourself rooted still
You couldn't find the anger to shout or kick
You just felt sad, and a little bit sick
And you woke me up and told me that I'd leave you for a girl from Brazil

And so I did my best to reassure you,
"I'm as faithful as the moon
And I'm waning off to Canberra,
but I'll wax and visit soon
And I'll sure as hell be tempted
By Brazilians on exchange
But I promise I'll stay faithful, girl,
and nothing has to change"

And I talk so big about monogamy,
I tell my friends I'm here to stay
But there's Brazilians right in front of me,
And you're so far away

and I didn't mean to cause you tears
I know you're just sixteen years old
But you are far, and she is near,
You live in Townsville, she lives here
You live in Townsville, she lives here

You live so far away now
We'll break up any day now
I don't want to hurt you
But you can't be hurt by what you don't know
And I'm a river my darling, and it's time for me to flow
And at the end of semester, she'll head home to Brazil.
