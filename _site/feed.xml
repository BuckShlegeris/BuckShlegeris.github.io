        <title>My advice on studying algorithms</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Software engineering interviews often ask whiteboard algorithms questions. Here’s my advice on how to study for them. (My credentials on this topic are:  I have passed a lot of whiteboard interviews, including at Google and Apple;  as part of my job I prepare programmers for these algorithm interviews; I have conducted more than 200 technical interviews on programmers with a very wide variety of backgrounds.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Counterfactual reasoning</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a kind of thought process which I enjoy, which I think is pretty core to EA. It’s a particular approach to answering questions of the form “should I do X”. It involves counterfactual reasoning, a bunch of basic microeconomics, and careful attention to your values.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do people date less if they have easy access to porn?</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s some evidence that access to pornography decreases sexual assault and child abuse. The proposed mechanism is that horny people get to watch more porn, and this makes them less sexually frustrated, which makes rape seem less tempting. Analogously, violent movies seem to reduce violence in the short term. Slate Star Codex discusses both of these effects &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/22/social-psychology-is-a-flamethrower/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://maggiemcneill.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pornography-rape-and-the-internet.pdf&quot;&gt;this linked paper&lt;/a&gt; considers all the objections that I’d thought of and seems pretty reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SMS vs email responsiveness</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s something I’ve learned recently: People are waaaaay more responsive to SMS than email. If you need to get a quick short response from someone, you should definitely text them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Testing whether two integers are different</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a super simple statistics question whose answer I didn’t know until just now: How do you test whether one integer is different from another?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hash-ordered treaps</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Hash-ordered treaps are a cool kind of binary search tree. They have the neat property that the mapping from ordered sets to hash-ordered treaps is one-to-one and onto. That is, for every ordered set, there’s exactly one valid hash-ordered treap which represents it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Triplebyte, the startup where I work, is hiring. We’re looking for engineers, a writer, a UX designer, and some generalist roles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Studying for startup interviews with &#39;Cracking the Coding Interview&#39;</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X&quot;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt; is by far the most popular interview prep book for software engineers. It’s a great book. But it was written for a few years ago, and software engineering interviews seem to have changed in the meantime, at least in the Silicon Valley engineering culture which I’m most involved in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A data structure for range kth-smallest queries</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to maintain a set of people where each has an age and a wealth. I want to be able to quickly insert people, delete people, and answer queries of the form “find the $l k$th richest person whose age is between $l x$ and $l y$”.&lt;/p&gt;
