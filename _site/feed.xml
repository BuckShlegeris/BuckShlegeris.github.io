        <title>Optimize dating for non-interference with platonic relationships</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;[content warning—I make a lot of claims that certain ways of hitting on people are much better than other ways. If you have a tendency to freak out about whether you’re a terrible person for being sexually attracted to people, maybe don’t read this.]&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flinching away from hard things</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a strong reflex to not do complicated things when I’m writing code—I flinch away and try really hard to avoid them. I think this reflex often serves me well, because complicated code is a pain to maintain and in real life you usually don’t need it. When I watch other people code, I often see them start down a complicated path to solve a problem, and then persevere through it. When faced with the same problems as them, I’m much more inclined to start down a complicated path, then realize it’s going to be complicated and reflexively give up. Most problems that I run across actually have relatively simple solutions, so this serves me well: I end up flailing for longer at the start, but then I end up with simpler code than I would have had otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;(I’m talking about computer science here because that’s the only topic I know really well, but this might generalize anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hyperactive Record</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun open source project which someone should build! I’ve written a readme and put it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bshlgrs/HyperactiveRecord/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; but I don’t think I have the time to actually build this. I present it here in the hope that one of you might decide that you like it and want to build it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data structure projects</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas for fun projects with data structures! I get really excited about data structures and if you want to ask me for clarification of any of these I’m super super happy to talk to you about them!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Optimize for fun when you&#39;re trying to learn</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When people ask me what they should learn to get better at something–playing piano, programming, doing math–they want me to tell them a particular skill which they should focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bleg for intro to web architecture</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I want a good resource for learning about general concepts in web application architecture?
Most of the content would be grouped by application layer. So the main sections would be like: data persistence, application servers, caching layers…&lt;/p&gt;
