        <title>Quickselect on multiple sorted arrays</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: Thanks heaps to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/1009831/evgeny-kluev&quot;&gt;Evgeny Kluev&lt;/a&gt;, the author of that original StackOverflow answer, for noticing that I’d made a mistake in the total time complexity calculation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quickselect on an unordered array and an order statistic tree</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I did this work myself, so there are probably mistakes. I think the conclusion is right though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Not thinking of things I can&#39;t say</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed recently that I usually don’t think of thoughts which I’m not going to be able to say for political correctness reasons. Occasionally when I talk to people who don’t care about offending progressives, they say really insightful things which I would never have thought of on my own, because my brain just blocks those thoughts out before I can think them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Optimize dating for non-interference with platonic relationships</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;[content warning—I make a lot of claims that certain ways of hitting on people are much better than other ways. If you have a tendency to freak out about whether you’re a terrible person for being sexually attracted to people, maybe don’t read this.]&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flinching away from hard things</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a strong reflex to not do complicated things when I’m writing code—I flinch away and try really hard to avoid them. I think this reflex often serves me well, because complicated code is a pain to maintain and in real life you usually don’t need it. When I watch other people code, I often see them start down a complicated path to solve a problem, and then persevere through it. When faced with the same problems as them, I’m much more inclined to start down a complicated path, then realize it’s going to be complicated and reflexively give up. Most problems that I run across actually have relatively simple solutions, so this serves me well: I end up flailing for longer at the start, but then I end up with simpler code than I would have had otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;(I’m talking about computer science here because that’s the only topic I know really well, but this might generalize anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hyperactive Record</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun open source project which someone should build! I’ve written a readme and put it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bshlgrs/HyperactiveRecord/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; but I don’t think I have the time to actually build this. I present it here in the hope that one of you might decide that you like it and want to build it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data structure projects</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas for fun projects with data structures! I get really excited about data structures and if you want to ask me for clarification of any of these I’m super super happy to talk to you about them!&lt;/p&gt;
