    <h1>An open letter to concerned meat eaters.</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>Dear meat eater:</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern about the well-being of the animal activism movement, and for your advice on how to run it. I appreciate your concern for the image of the animal activism movement, and I appreciate you taking the time to give us advice on how to get our message across more effectively.</p>
<p>In particular, I have received your observation that attempts to persuade people out of their speciesists are often seen as rude or offensive -- along with your suggestion that we therefore should stop making our case altogether. I have also received your suggestion that, if we do feel it necessary to point out the flaws in speciesism, we do so gently and diplomatically, making the avoidance of any possible offense or hurt feelings our absolute top priority. I have received your observation that attempts to persuade people out of speciesist beliefs can be divisive, possibly alienating those who might be enthusiastic about changes to laws to improve animal treatment -- and I have received your suggestion that we should therefore concentrate entirely on particularly egregious cases of cruelty that even mainstream society dislikes, and abandon any focus on pointing out the flaws in speciesism or the harm done by it.

And I have received your suggestion that we avoid any use of anger, humor, mockery, passion, and other traditional methods of drawing attention to controversial ideas, and that in the future we make our case soberly, moderately, and with little fanfare. These suggestions are certainly interesting, and I will give them all due consideration.</p>

<p>However, while your concern for the well-being of the animal activism movement is certainly appreciated, I can assure you that it is unwarranted.</p>

<p>The animal activism movement is doing extraordinarily well -- especially for a movement that has only become seriously mobilized in the last few years. Animal rights has gone from being on virtually nobody's radar, to being a major topic of conversation at water-coolers and in op-ed pieces, in a matter of a few years. We have made astonishing strides in visibility, for our issues and for our very existence, in an extremely short period of time.</p>

<p>And rates of veganism and engagement with the animal rights movement are going up at a substantial rate -- a rate that even surprises many of us -- all over the United States and all over the world. This trend is especially true among young people... arguably the most important demographic for any social change movement. What's more, I personally have been told by several people that they have started to care about animal rights issues, in part, because of things I've written. And I know that I joined this movement, in large part, because of things that were written by people in the animal activism movement.</p>

<p>Clearly, we are doing something right.</p>

<p>It is difficult to avoid the observation that, whenever meat eaters give advice to animal activisms on how to run our movement, it is always in the direction of telling us to be more quiet, to tone it down, to be less confrontational and less visible. I have yet to see a meat eater advise the animal activism movement to speak up more loudly and more passionately; to make our arguments more compelling and more unanswerable; to get in people's faces more about delicate and thorny issues that they don't want to think about; to not be afraid of offending people if we think we're right. I have received a great deal of advice from meat eaters on how animal activisms should run our movement... and it is always, always, always in the direction of politely suggesting that we shut up.</p>

<p>You'll have to forgive me if I question the motivation behind this advice, and take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>You'll have to forgive me if I think your suggestions on making our movement more effective would, in fact, have the exact opposite effect. What's more, you'll have to forgive me for suspecting that this, however unconsciously, is the true intention behind your very kind and no doubt sincerely- meant advice.</p>

<p>And you'll have to forgive me if I am less than enthusiastic about taking advice on how to run the animal activism movement from the very people our movement is trying to change.</p>

<p>Your concern is duly noted. Thank you for sharing.</p>
