Lyrics:
I read Jezebel every day
I read Jezebel every day
I spell trans* with a star
I know what privileges are
And when the lights go out you'll say
How you wish you had a man who says that he reads Jezebel every day

You might have kissed him before, you can't remember his name
He smiles, you wink, and who could blame you
He's here for the same reason as you
To find somebody who
Has nowhere else to be tonight
And might as well be with you

And he's a cute guy, and now he's trying to chat you up
And he's a douchebag, but he's probably a decent fuck
And with every word he's piecing through your flaws and insecurities
And hoping that the tricks he's learned
From all the pick up artist books he's read
Will convince you to take him back to your bed
And you'd love to prove him wrong, but tonight
You might just prove him right.

But don't you ever get the feeling, though you understand you're a
Strong independant white woman who just don't need no man
The feeling, you'd rather kiss a boy who'd say
He reads Upworthy every day

Your tongue's in his mouth, and you're wondering if he
Thinks you're a shitty lock, and he's an awesome key
He probably thinks that you're some scumbag whore
So what the fuck are you worrying for?
If he can sleep with people he disdains, then why can't you?

And your hands were tingling, but now they've turned to fists
Because he spent too many evenings on Chateau Heartiste
And now he speaks entirely in sexist quotes from misogynistic misanthropic pick up artist blogs

And even though you don't demand a man who must agree
On every item of feminist strategy
You'd at least hope for a lover
Who won't text beneath the covers
To tell all his friends he met online

â€¦

You've grown up a lot since your pink princess days
You're a feminist now, but the truth cuts both ways
And you have learnd that you are not a damsel in distress
But you've also learned that you are not the prettiest

But he's the cutest guy who so far you've been able to see
And the proportion that you've looked at is more than 1 on e (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem)
And you have learned that compromise is something we all have to do sometimes
You grit your teeth and grab his face

And tell him to take you home, in the gap between songs
And he smiles with his teeth, like a warrior who's won
Or a hunter whose prey has collapsed at his feet
And you hate feeling beat
But it's better than sleeping alone
