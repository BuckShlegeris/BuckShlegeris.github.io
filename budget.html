<h2>Silver linings in the 2014/15 budget</h2>

<p>Many of my friends were rightly upset with the new Australian budget. In my general spirit of contrariness, I thought I'd try to provide a bit of consolation to my countrymen.</p>

<h3>Foreign aid cuts</h3>

<p>The $7.5 billion dollar cuts to foreign aid over the next few years are a shame. However, it's worth remembering that most of the government's foreign aid is aimed at fairly ineffective projects like education and environmental protection. If only 20% of the budget is aimed at life-saving measures, and the average health intervention provided by DFAT is an order of magnitude less efficient than, say, SCI, then that's only about forty thousand unneccesary deaths we're causing with these budget cuts.</p>

<p>Hmm, that's actually not very comforting.</p>
