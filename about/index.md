# Buck Shlegeris

<div class="lead">
   <p>I am a software engineer from Australia. I have lived in San Francisco for most of the last three years. I'm interested in data structures and effective altruism.</p>
   <p>I work at <a href="https://triplebyte.com">Triplebyte</a>.</p>
   <p>I make fun music like <a href="http://soundcloud.com/buckmbs" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

## Background

I studied computer science and physics at the Australian National University for two years. At the end of 2013, after completing enough courses to get a computer science major, I moved to San Francisco for App Academy. After the nine week course, App Academy offered me a job as a TA. I worked there until returning to Australia for university in June. You can read an interview I did about App Academy [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy).

After graduating, I moved back to SF; I worked for PayPal in Scala for most of a year, then left to work at Triplebyte.

## Programming
Within computer science, my main interests are advanced data structures, programming language implementation, and functional programming.

I recently tried to <a href="/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html">exhaustively catalogue solutions</a> to problems of the form "given a set of data structures, find the $latex k$th smallest item in their union". I love data structures which can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, such as augmented binary search trees. I hate interview questions <a href="/2016/04/22/dumbest-algorithm-problem.html">like this one</a> which use pseudo-algorithmic problems as an excuse to ask people useless brainteasers. I like thinking about algorithmic problems which result from taking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bshlgrs/posts/10207757972162021">simple games like Connect-4</a> and seeing what happens when you make them much larger. Occasionally my interest in polyamory crosses over with my interest in algorithms, <a href="/2015/08/08/poly-np.html">with amusing results.</a>

You can play <a href="/music-game">this game</a> which I made to practise relative pitch, or <a href="/math-game">this game</a> which I made to memorize the relationships between different types of functions in real analysis.

I recently worked with Michael Dickens on a quantitative model for cause prioritization. You can try the model <a href="http://mdickens.me/causepri-app">here</a>. This project started out entirely motivated by desire to estimate cost-effectiveness of different non-profits, and somehow ended up as the most interesting algorithm design problem which I've ever needed to solve for a practical purpose.

### Ruining the coding interview

<p>One of my most interesting programming projects is an effort to automatically choose fast data structures, given a description of the API they need to support. You read a full descripion on <a href="https://github.com/bshlgrs/ruining-the-coding-interview">GitHub</a>, or in this talk I gave at Scala By The Bay 2015:</p>

## Music

I write songs and used to play them with my band [Buck et al](https://www.facebook.com/bucketal) in Canberra.

## Effective altruism

I'm a utilitarian and care a lot about making the world better.

Currently, I'm mostly trying to do good by [earning to give](http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give).

I'm involved with the effective altruism movement, which has sprung up in recent years around organizations like <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> (of which I am a member), <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Center for Effective Altruism</a>. I regularly attend the Stanford effective altruism meetups.

In 2015, I was on a panel at EA Global in Mountain View.

I wrote about the biggest effective altruism mistakes I made in 2014 and 2015 <a href="/2016/05/24/mistakes.html">here.</a>

Last year, I differentiated the equation `happiness = log(income)` with respect to income, and tried to use this to decide how much we should be willing to spend to save a life. You can read the disappointingly non-robust results <a href="/2015/08/08/value-of-life.html">here</a>.

### Donation history

Since I started working, I've donated $48560.

In 2014, I donated about 10% of my income. In 2015, I donated about 30%. Here's a complete record:

</tr>
</table>

I donated to a donor-advised fund at the end of 2015, because I was unsure about
where I should donate. I am still figuring out where to donate it.
