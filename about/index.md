# Buck Shlegeris


<p>I am a software engineer from Australia. I have lived in San Francisco for most of the last three years. I'm interested in data structures and effective altruism.</p>

<p>I make fun music like <a href="http://soundcloud.com/buckmbs" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

## Background

I grew up in Townsville, Australia. After high school, I studied computer science and physics at the Australian National University for two years. At the end of 2013, I moved to San Francisco for App Academy. After the nine week course, App Academy offered me a job as a TA. I worked there until returning to Australia to finish my degree. You can read an interview I did about App Academy [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy). Somehow I managed to convince ANU that App Academy counted as a semester abroad, so I graduated with just one more semester of university.

After graduating, I moved back to SF; I worked for PayPal in Scala for most of a year, then left to work at Triplebyte. After about two years there, I quit my job to move into AI safety work.

## Programming

Within computer science, my main interests are advanced data structures, programming language implementation, and functional programming.

I wrote <a href="http://ds.shlegeris.com">a search engine for data structures</a> and presented on it at Scala By The Bay 2016; you can read about it [here](http://shlegeris.com/2016/11/13/ds.html). I presented on a similar project at  Scala By The Bay 2015; you can see a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPFga7eg3Uw).

## Music

I write songs and used to play them with my band [Buck et al](https://www.facebook.com/bucketal) in Canberra.

## Effective altruism

I'm a utilitarian and care a lot about making the world better.

I'm involved with the effective altruism movement, which has sprung up in recent years around organizations like <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> (of which I am a member), <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a>, and the <a href="http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">Center for Effective Altruism</a>.

In 2015, I was on a panel at EA Global in Mountain View. In 2016, I ran a workshop on advanced career planning for EA software engineers.

I wrote about the biggest effective altruism mistakes I made in 2014 and 2015 <a href="/2016/05/24/mistakes.html">here.</a>

I contracted for the Open Philanthropy Project for a while working on a project to [model some features of an illusionist account of consciousness](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/software-agent-illustrating-some-features-illusionist-account-consciousness).

I donated to a donor-advised fund at the end of 2015, because I was unsure about where I should donate. -->
